Touch-Linked Sleeve: A Haptic Interface for Augmented Tactile Perception in Robotic Teleoperation.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11245835,"Tactile perception is crucial for robots to interact effectively with their environments, particularly in cluttered settings or when visual sensing is unavailable. However, a major limitation is the insufficient coverage of tactile sensors on current robots, which makes navigating cluttered spaces challenging due to the lack of capability to detect collisions. This limitation also hinders the use of teleoperation systems in such spaces by reducing the human operatorâs situational awareness. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Touch-Linked Sleeve (TLS), a haptic mapping system that redirects contact on robot arms to human skin. The system consists of a tactile skin for contact detection and a haptic sleeve that enables human operators to experience telepresented contact. By establishing a transparent mapping between the robotâs tactile skin and the userâs haptic sleeve, operators can intuitively sense contacts from the robotâs perspective. To evaluate the systemâs effectiveness, we conducted experiments demonstrating the functionality of both the tactile skin and the haptic sleeve. Moreover, we performed human studies using a virtual reality robot teleoperation interface to simulate navigation and manipulation in a cluttered scenario. The results indicate that the proposed system enhances perceptual transparency during object grasping tasks, leading to improved task completion times, fewer collisions, and improved overall usability."
Noise Fusion-based Distillation Learning for Anomaly Detection in Complex Industrial Environments.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247510,"Anomaly detection and localization in automated industrial manufacturing can significantly enhance production efficiency and product quality. Existing methods are capable of detecting surface defects in pre-defined or controlled imaging environments. However, accurately detecting workpiece defects in complex and unstructured industrial environments with varying views, poses and illumination remains challenging. We propose a novel anomaly detection and localization method specifically designed to handle inputs with perturbative patterns. Our approach introduces a new framework based on a collaborative distillation heterogeneous teacher network (HetNet), an adaptive local-global feature fusion module, and a local multivariate Gaussian noise generation module. HetNet can learn to model the complex feature distribution of normal patterns using limited information about local disruptive changes. We conducted extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks. HetNet demonstrates superior performance with approximately 10% improvement across all evaluation metrics on MSC-AD under industrial conditions, while achieving state-of-the-art results on other datasets, validating its resilience to environmental fluctuations and its capability to enhance the reliability of industrial anomaly detection systems across diverse scenarios. Tests in real-world environments further confirm that HetNet can be effectively integrated into production lines to achieve robust and real-time anomaly detection.

Neural MP: A Neural Motion Planner.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246908,"The current paradigm for motion planning generates solutions from scratch for every new problem, which consumes significant amounts of time and computational resources. For complex, cluttered scenes, motion planning approaches can often take minutes to produce a solution, while humans are able to accurately and safely reach any goal in seconds by leveraging their prior experience. We seek to do the same by applying data-driven learning at scale to the problem of motion planning. Our approach builds a large number of complex scenes in simulation, collects expert data from a motion planner, then distills it into a reactive neural policy. We then combine this with lightweight optimization to obtain a safe path for real world deployment. We perform a thorough evaluation of our method on 64 motion planning tasks across four diverse environments with randomized poses, scenes and obstacles, in the real world, demonstrating an improvement of 23%, 17% and 79% motion planning success rate over state of the art sampling, optimization and learning based planning methods. All code, models and datasets will be released on acceptance. Video results available at mihdalal.github.io/neuralmotionplanner."
Interactive Navigation for Legged Manipulators with Learned Arm-Pushing Controller.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246770,"Interactive navigation is crucial in scenarios where proactively interacting with objects can yield shorter paths, thus significantly improving traversal efficiency. Existing methods primarily focus on using the robot body to relocate obstacles during navigation. However, they prove ineffective in narrow or constrained spaces where the robotâs dimensions restrict its manipulation capabilities. This paper introduces a novel interactive navigation framework for legged manipulators, featuring an active arm-pushing mechanism that enables the robot to reposition movable obstacles in space-constrained environments. To this end, we develop a reinforcement learning-based arm-pushing controller with a two-stage reward strategy for object manipulation. Specifically, this strategy first directs the manipulator to a designated pushing zone to achieve a kinematically feasible contact configuration. Then, the end effector is guided to maintain its position at appropriate contact points for stable object displacement while preventing toppling. The simulations validate the robustness of the arm-pushing controller, showing that the two-stage reward strategy improves policy convergence and long-term performance. Real-World experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed navigation framework, which achieves shorter paths and reduced traversal time.

Implicit Disparity-Blur Alignment for Fast and Precise Autofocus in Robotic Microsurgical Imaging.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246648,"Creating an intelligent surgical environment requires not only advanced robotic systems but also optimized microscopic imaging. However, autofocus remains a fundamental challenge, with current methods suffering from slow iterative processes or directional ambiguity, which compromises real-time performance. This paper presents an implicit disparity-blur alignment approach for robotic microsurgical autofocus, integrating stereo geometryâs monotonic depth cues with de-focus characteristics for rapid convergence. A novel physics-guided dual-stream network is developed to encode implicit depth representations through hierarchical cross-pathway feature fusion, enabling reliable focus prediction without explicit stereo matching in blur-degraded regions. An ROI-aware attention module is proposed to dynamically optimize focus-critical regions, coupled with learnable physics-guided kernel learning for precise Z-offset estimation. The approach achieves a top directional accuracy of 94.85% and a single-pass focus error of 0.20 mm with an inference time of 53 ms on a surgical dataset, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reducing iteration count by 22.8% and inference time by 51.8%. An intelligent robotic microscope prototype is developed, with validation through ex vivo tests demonstrating its ability to enable fast and precise multi-region focusing for microsurgeries."
Accelerating Layered Manufacturing-Based 3D Printing through Optimized Non-Printing Travel-Path Planning and Infill Strategies.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246488,"This paper presents a rapid 3D printing framework that enhances the efficiency of commercially available layered manufacturing-based 3D printers. Unlike traditional methods that simplify printing regions to a single point or rely on predefined entry and exit points, our approach utilizes an improved Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) algorithm to autonomously generate an optimized, cyclic printing path, while automatically assigning entry and exit points for each region. This minimizes non-printing paths and improves efficiency. Additionally, we propose a principal axis calculation method for irregular shapes, aligning better with geometric orientation. This optimization enhances infill uniformity and surface smoothness. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework improves printing efficiency while maintaining print quality, with promising applicability to large-scale and complex 3D printing models."
Designing a Magnetic Endoscope for In Vivo Contact-Based Tissue Scanning Using Developable Roller.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247414,"Magnetic manipulation has been adopted as a method of actuation in both wireless capsule endoscopy and soft-tethered endoscopy, with the goal of improving gastrointestinal procedures. However, by nature of magnetic manipulation, these endoscopes are typically limited to a maximum of five degrees of freedom (DoF). With the need to introduce additional contact-based sensing modalities for subsurface investigation into these systems as well as to improve overall dexterity, it is both practically and clinically beneficial to recover the lost DoF i.e. the roll around the main axis. This paper presents a method of achieving the magnetic manipulation of an underactuated device by leveraging developable surfaces, specifically, the oloid shape. The design of a clinically relevant magnetic endoscope with all its ancillary elements, as well as contact sensors, is proposed and demonstrated in vivo. The contact sensor data from the in vivo experiments show that for sweeping motions over 100Â° of roll, contact between the endoscopeâs sensor region and the colon wall can be maintained for 74% of the motion."
PhysGCN-DL: Physics-Informed Graph Convolutional Networks with Diversity-Aware Loss Optimization for Multimodal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246407,"Pedestrian trajectory prediction ensures safe navigation in autonomous driving and intelligent robots. Existing methods have shown promising results but still face challenges in handling dynamic environments, social interactions, and high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a novel PhysGCN-DL within the itransformer framework to address these challenges. Our model incorporates physically-inspired dynamic interaction modeling by representing physical interactions between pedestrians as edge weights in graph convolution. This approach captures the heterogeneity of pedestrian movement and improves the interpretability of social interactions. Moreover, we design a novel loss function to jointly enhance prediction diversity and accuracy, thereby improving the modelâs robustness across both dense and sparse scenarios. Empirical evaluations confirm that our approach outperforms existing methods in generating accurate and diverse pedestrian trajectories."
Reinforcement Learning Assist-As-Needed Control Promotes Recovery of Walking Speed Following Ankle Weight Perturbations.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246270,"Self-selected walking speed is a key outcome for exercise-based rehabilitation programs following lower-extremity trauma. This work introduces a novel reinforcement learning-based assist-as-needed (RL-AAN) controller for ankle exoskeletons, aimed at gait speed training. Built on an actorâcritic architecture, the RL-AAN controller integrates a control objective that balances the trade-off between expected stride velocity (SV) errors and exoskeleton assistance. This approach allows the exoskeleton to progressively reduce ankle plantar- and dorsiflexion (PDF) assistance as the userâs performance improves, promoting active participation. The desired assistive torque is computed as the product of the actor output and the wearerâs biomechanical ankle PDF moment, estimated by a subject-agnostic model, thereby ensuring personalized and biomechanically relevant assistance. In a proof-of-concept study with healthy individuals walking on a self-paced treadmill with ankle weights, the RL-AAN controller outperformed a conventional Fixed-K controllerâachieving greater immediate speed increases during assisted walking (14.2% vs. 10.0% relative to unassisted perturbed walking) and inducing short-term gait speed adaptation post-training, not observed with the conventional controller. These findings highlight the potential of RL-AAN control for subject-tailored gait training, with promising clinical implications for exercise-based rehabilitation in individuals with neurological or musculoskeletal gait impairments."
Autonomous Hiking Trail Navigation via Semantic Segmentation and Geometric Analysis.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11245853,"Natural environments pose significant challenges for autonomous robot navigation, particularly due to their unstructured and ever-changing nature. Hiking trails, with their dynamic conditions influenced by weather, vegetation, and human traffic, represent one of these challenges. This work introduces a novel approach to autonomous hiking trail navigation that balances trail adherence with the flexibility to adapt to off-trail routes when necessary. The solution is a Traversability Analysis module that integrates semantic data from camera images with geometric information from LiDAR to create a comprehensive understanding of the surrounding terrain. A planner uses this traversability map to navigate safely, adhering to trails while allowing off-trail movement when necessary to avoid on-trail hazards or for safe off-trail shortcuts. The method is evaluated through simulation to determine the balance between semantic and geometric information in traversability estimation. These simulations tested various weights to assess their impact on navigation performance across different trail scenarios. Weights were then validated through autonomous field tests at the West Virginia University Core Arboretum, demonstrating the methodâs effectiveness in a real-world environment."
GeT-USE: Learning Generalized Tool Usage for Bimanual Mobile Manipulation via Simulated Embodiment Extensions.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11245978,"The ability to use random objects as tools in a generalizable manner is a missing piece in robotsâ intelligence today to boost their versatility and problem-solving capabilities. State-of-the-art robotic tool usage methods focused on procedurally generating or crowd-sourcing datasets of tools for a task to learn how to grasp and manipulate them for that task. However, these methods assume that only one object is provided and that it is possible, with the correct grasp, to perform the task; they are not capable of identifying, grasping, and using the best object for a task when many are available, especially when the optimal tool is absent. In this work, we propose GeT-USE, a two-step procedure that learns to perform real-robot generalized tool usage by learning first to extend the robotâs embodiment in simulation and then transferring the learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies. Our key insight is that by exploring a robotâs embodiment extensions (i.e., building new end-effectors) in simulation, the robot can identify the general tool geometries most beneficial for a task. This learned geometric knowledge can then be distilled to perform generalized tool usage tasks by selecting and using the best available real-world object as tool. On a real robot with 22 degrees of freedom (DOFs), GeT-USE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 30-60% success rates across three vision-based bimanual mobile manipulation tool-usage tasks."
PlaceNet: Obstacle Aware Mobile Manipulator Base Placement through Deep Learning.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247631,"In this work, we present PlaceNet: a deep learning framework for mobile manipulator base placement which provides solutions to the shortcomings common in the state-of-the-art. Our method addresses the lack of obstacle awareness of reachability methods and the limited generalization of learning methods. Using only the raw pointcloud and task pose data as input, PlaceNet learns the concepts of reachability and obstacle occlusions in an environment-independent manner, enabling its use in situations outside its training experiences. Tests comparing PlaceNet to inverse reachability and heuristic methods demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in both the In-Distribution and Out-Of-Distribution test sets, achieving as high as 98% success rate for problems with many solutions, and an 82% success rate overall. PlaceNet can be trained on grounded pointcloud data from any source without the need for dynamic simulation, marking it as an accessible alternative to similar frameworks which require expensive, high-performance GPUs for running simultaneous simulation and training or which depend on labor intensive data collection. PlaceNet is lightweight during deployment and can easily run with low latency on affordable hardware, including laptop GPUs and the NVIDIA Jetson line for embedded deployment."
Benchmarking Long-Horizon Mobile Manipulation in Multi-Room Dynamic Environments.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11245866,"Long-horizon reasoning and task execution are crucial for complex mobile manipulation tasks in household environments. Existing benchmarks and methods primarily focus on single-room or single-object mobile manipulation scenarios, limiting the scope of long-horizon planning and scene-level understanding. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark for long-horizon mobile manipulation in multi-room household environments. Our task requires agents to follow a sequence of language instructions, each directing the movement of specific objects across receptacles and rooms. In this task, we investigate the role of long-term memory by constructing a hierarchical scene graph that captures the relationships between objects, furniture, and rooms. This scene graph-based memory is dynamically updated as the agent explores the environment, which effectively aligns the scene information with the targets and environmental context specified in the language instructions. Additionally, we benchmark the proposed task in dynamic environments where objects can be relocated during task execution, simulating real-world scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the scene graph-based memory significantly improves the agentâs performance in long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks. Moreover, dynamically updating the state of objects within the scene graph enables the agent to better adapt to dynamic conditions."
Manipulate-To-Navigate: Reinforcement Learning with Visual Affordances and Manipulability Priors.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247222,"Mobile manipulation in dynamic environments is challenging due to movable obstacles blocking the robotâs path. Traditional methods, which treat navigation and manipulation as separate tasks, often fail in such ""manipulate-to-navigate"" scenarios, as obstacles must be removed before navigation. In these cases, active interaction with the environment is required to clear obstacles while ensuring sufficient space for movement. To address the manipulate-to-navigate problem, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach for learning manipulation actions that facilitate subsequent navigation. Our method combines manipulability priors to focus the robot on high manipulability body positions with affordance maps for selecting high-quality manipulation actions. By focusing on feasible and meaningful actions, our approach reduces unnecessary exploration and allows the robot to learn manipulation strategies more effectively.We present two new manipulate-to-navigate simulation tasks called Reach and Door with the Boston Dynamics Spot robot. The first task tests whether the robot can select a good hand position in the target area such that the robot base can move effectively forward while keeping the end effector position fixed. The second task requires the robot to move a door aside in order to clear the navigation path. Both of these tasks need first manipulation and then navigating the base forward. Results show that our method allows a robot to effectively interact with and traverse dynamic environments. Finally, we transfer the learned policy to a real Boston Dynamics Spot robot, which successfully performs the Reach task."
CushionCatch: A Compliant Catching Mechanism for Mobile Manipulators via Combined Optimization and Learning.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246275,"Catching flying objects with a cushioning process is a skill commonly performed by humans, yet it remains a significant challenge for robots. In this paper, we present a framework that combines optimization and learning to achieve compliant catching on mobile manipulators (CCMM). First, we propose a high-level capture planner for mobile manipulators (MM) that calculates the optimal capture point and joint configuration. Next, the pre-catching (PRC) planner ensures the robot reaches the target joint configuration as quickly as possible. To learn compliant catching strategies, we propose a network that leverages the strengths of LSTM for capturing temporal dependencies and positional encoding for spatial context (P-LSTM). This network is designed to effectively learn compliant strategies from human demonstrations. Following this, the post-catching (POC) planner tracks the compliant sequence output by the P-LSTM while avoiding potential collisions due to structural differences between humans and robots. We validate the CCMM framework through both simulated and real-world ball-catching scenarios, achieving a success rate of 98.70% in simulation, 92.59% in real-world tests, and a 28.7% reduction in impact torques. The open source code will be released for the reference of the community<sup>1</sup>."
Learning Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation with Multifingered Hands via Visuomotor Diffusion.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247641,"We present a framework for learning dexterous in-hand manipulation with multifingered hands using visuo-motor diffusion policies. Our system enables complex in-hand manipulation tasks, such as unscrewing a bottle lid with one hand, by leveraging a fast and responsive teleoperation setup for the four-fingered Allegro Hand. We collect high-quality expert demonstrations using an augmented reality (AR) interface that tracks hand movements and applies inverse kinematics and motion retargeting for precise control. The AR headset provides real-time visualization, while gesture controls streamline teleoperation. To enhance policy learning, we introduce a novel demonstration outlier removal approach based on HDBSCAN clustering and the Global-Local Outlier Score from Hierarchies (GLOSH) algorithm, effectively filtering out low-quality demonstrations that could degrade performance. We evaluate our approach extensively in real-world settings and provide all experimental videos on the project website.<sup>1</sup>."
Wearable Roller Rings to Augment In-Hand Manipulation through Active Surfaces.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247531,"In-hand manipulation is a crucial ability for reorienting and repositioning objects within grasps. The main challenges in this are not only the complexity of the computational models, but also the risks of grasp instability caused by active finger motions, such as rolling, sliding, breaking, and remaking contacts. This paper presents the development of the Roller Ring (RR), a modular robotic attachment with active surfaces that is wearable by both robot and human hands to manipulate without lifting a finger. By installing the angled RRs on hands, such that their spatial motions are not colinear, we derive a general differential motion model for manipulating objects. Our motion model shows that complete in-hand manipulation skill sets can be provided by as few as only 2 RRs through non-holonomic object motions, while more RRs can enable enhanced manipulation dexterity with fewer motion constraints. Through extensive experiments, we test the RRs on both a robot hand and a human hand to evaluate their manipulation capabilities. We show that the RRs can be employed to manipulate arbitrary object shapes to provide dexterous in-hand manipulation."
Open-loop Deep Reinforcement Learning Control of Soft Robotic In-hand Manipulations.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11245997,"In-hand manipulation tasks using hand-like robotic grippers offer a promising approach to accomplish various tasks in a human-centered environment. Due to the inherent safety of soft robots, in-hand manipulations performed by soft robots provide great opportunities for future human-robot collaboration, which is the scope of this paper. By modeling a new and innovative soft-robotic gripper known as the Anthropomorphic Soft Gripper and synthesis of an open-loop controller with deep reinforcement learning, it is demonstrated how the movement of objects by in-hand manipulations can be accomplished. Moreover, this work explores the application of deep reinforcement learning methods without the employment for domain randomization. As noted by Bhatt et al. the inherent soft properties of soft robotic grippers enable remarkably robust in-hand manipulation in open-loop control, giving the impetus for the approach that is being followed in this work. Motion sequences generated in simulation are successfully transferred to the real anthropomorphic soft gripper and validated in experiments."
Vibration-induced Friction Modulation to Enable Controlled Sliding for In-hand Manipulation.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247140,"Achieving controlled sliding of objects on finger surfaces is a significant challenge for robots, substantially constraining their ability to perform complex in-hand manipulation tasks. In this work, we investigate the role of surface vibration in modulating the effective friction at the object-finger contact locations to facilitate controlled sliding. We demonstrate that friction at contact points can be reduced by applying targeted vibrations at specific locations on a robotic finger, creating regions that are suitable for sliding. In this way, we create sticking/sliding regions on finger surfaces on demand and can easily switch between sliding and rolling contacts. To investigate this phenomenon, we embedded an array of vibration modules into robotic fingers. We first analyzed the velocity fields created by surface vibrations on a single finger. Then, we developed a method to select the appropriate activation states of the modules that achieve the desired velocity field at a given object location. Utilizing these fingers and the vibration selection method, we formed a two-finger robotic hand and demonstrated controlled sliding and rotation of a held object within the hand. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes vibration-induced friction modulation for in-hand manipulation that can achieve combinations of object sliding and rolling actions."
On the Role of Jacobians in Robust Manipulation.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247725,"Traditional robot control relies on analytical methods that require precise system models, which are hard to apply in real-world settings and limit generalization to arbitrary tasks. However, systems like serial manipulators and passively adaptive hands feature inherently stable regions without control discontinuities like loss of contact or singularities. In these regions, approximate controllers focusing on the correct direction of motion enable successful coarse manipulation. When coupled with a rough estimation of the motion magnitude, precision manipulation is achieved. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel inverse Jacobian estimation method that independently estimates the primary motion direction and magnitude of the manipulatorâs actuators. Our method efficiently estimates the direct mapping from task to actuator space with no need for a priori system knowledge enabling the same framework to control both hands and arms without compromising task performance. We present a novel control method with no a priori knowledge for precision manipulation. Experiments on the Yale Model O hand, Yale Stewart Hand, and a UR5e arm demonstrate that the inverse Jacobians estimated via our approach enable real-time control with submillimeter precision in manipulation tasks. These results highlight that online self-ID data alone is sufficient for precise real-world manipulation."
Analysis and Mitigation of Inconsistencies in Blockchain-Enabled Robot Swarms.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247266,"Recent research has demonstrated that blockchain-enabled robot swarmsâwhere robots coordinate using blockchain technologyâcan secure robot swarms by neutralizing malicious and malfunctioning robots. This security is achieved through blockchain technologyâs consistency properties. However, prior work addressed malfunctions at the information level, that is, it studied how to neutralize robots that stored information in the blockchain that did not correspond to the real-world state (i.e., it studied the oracle problem). In contrast, this study focuses on inconsistencies at the blockchain protocol level. We analyze how network partitions, which may arise from robotsâ local-only communication capabilities, malfunctioning hardware, or external attacks, can lead to inconsistent information in a robot swarm. In order to mitigate these disruptions, we propose a decentralized approach to detect partitions and a corresponding response. We study our approach in a swarm robotics simulator, where we demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing blockchain inconsistencies."
Integrating Opinion Dynamics into Safety Control for Decentralized Airplane Encounter Resolution.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246160,"As the airspace becomes increasingly congested, decentralized conflict resolution methods for airplane encounters have become essential. While decentralized safety controllers can prevent dangerous midair collisions, they do not always ensure prompt conflict resolution. As a result, airplane progress may be blocked for extended periods in certain situations. To address this blocking phenomenon, this paper proposes integrating bio-inspired nonlinear opinion dynamics into the airplane safety control framework, thereby guaranteeing both safety and blocking-free resolution. In particular, opinion dynamics enable the safety controller to achieve collaborative decision-making for blocking resolution and facilitate rapid, safe coordination without relying on communication or preset rules. Extensive simulation results validate the improved flight efficiency and safety guarantees. This study provides practical insights into the design of autonomous controllers for airplanes."
Robots that Suggest Safe Alternatives.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247186,"Goal-conditioned policies, such as those learned via imitation learning, provide an easy way for humans to influence what tasks robots accomplish. However, these robot policies are not guaranteed to execute safely or to succeed when faced with out-of-distribution goal requests. In this work, we enable robots to know when they can confidently execute a userâs desired goal, and automatically suggest safe alternatives when they cannot. Our approach is inspired by control-theoretic safety filtering, wherein a safety filter minimally adjusts a robotâs candidate action to be safe. Our key idea is to pose alternative suggestion as a safe control problem in goal space, rather than in action space. Offline, we use reachability analysis to compute a goal-parameterized reach-avoid value network which quantifies the safety and liveness of the robotâs pre-trained policy. Online, our robot uses the reach-avoid value network as a safety filter, monitoring the humanâs given goal and actively suggesting alternatives that are similar but meet the safety specification. We demonstrate our Safe ALTernatives (SALT) framework in simulation experiments with Franka Panda tabletop manipulation. We find that SALT is able to learn to predict successful and failed closed-loop executions, is a less pessimistic monitor than open-loop uncertainty quantification, and proposes alternatives that consistently align with those that people find acceptable."
"Safe, Task-Consistent Manipulation with Operational Space Control Barrier Functions.",https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246389,"Safe real-time control of robotic manipulators in unstructured environments requires handling numerous safety constraints without compromising task performance. Traditional approaches, such as artificial potential fields (APFs), suffer from local minima, oscillations, and limited scalability, while model predictive control (MPC) can be computationally expensive. Control barrier functions (CBFs) offer a promising alternative due to their high level of robustness and low computational cost, but these safety filters must be carefully designed to avoid significant reductions in the overall performance of the manipulator. In this work, we introduce an Operational Space Control Barrier Function (OSCBF) framework that integrates safety constraints while preserving task-consistent behavior. Our approach scales to hundreds of simultaneous constraints while retaining real-time control rates, ensuring collision avoidance, singularity prevention, and workspace containment even in highly cluttered settings or during dynamic motions. By explicitly accounting for the task hierarchy in the CBF objective, we prevent degraded performance across both joint-space and operational-space tasks, when at the limit of safety. We validate performance in both simulation and hardware, and release our open-source high-performance code and media on our project webpage, https://stanfordasl.github.io/oscbf/"
Secure Safety Filter: Towards Safe Flight Control under Sensor Attacks.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247729,"Modern autopilot systems are prone to sensor attacks that can jeopardize flight safety. To mitigate this risk, we proposed a modular solution: the secure safety filter, which extends the well-established control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filter to account for, and mitigate, sensor attacks. This module consists of a secure state reconstructor (which generates plausible states) and a safety filter (which computes the safe control input that is closest to the nominal one). Differing from existing work focusing on linear, noise-free systems, the proposed secure safety filter handles bounded measurement noise and, by leveraging reduced-order model techniques, is applicable to the nonlinear dynamics of drones. Software-in-the-loop simulations and drone hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the secure safety filter in rendering the system safe in the presence of sensor attacks."
SHIELD: Safety on Humanoids via CBFs In Expectation on Learned Dynamics.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247065,"Robot learning has produced remarkably effective ""black-box"" controllers for complex tasks such as dynamic locomotion on humanoids. Yet ensuring dynamic safety, i.e., constraint satisfaction, remains challenging for such policies. Reinforcement learning (RL) embeds constraints heuristically through reward engineering, and adding or modifying constraints requires retraining. Model-based approaches, like control barrier functions (CBFs), enable runtime constraint specification with formal guarantees but require accurate dynamics models. This paper presents SHIELD, a layered safety framework that bridges this gap by: (1) training a generative, stochastic dynamics residual model using real-world data from hardware rollouts of the nominal controller, capturing system behavior and uncertainties; and (2) adding a safety layer on top of the nominal (learned locomotion) controller that leverages this model via a stochastic discrete-time CBF formulation enforcing safety constraints in probability. The result is a minimally-invasive safety layer that can be added to the existing autonomy stack to give probabilistic guarantees of safety that balance risk and performance. In hardware experiments on an Unitree G1 humanoid, SHIELD enables safe navigation (obstacle avoidance) through varied indoor and outdoor environments using a nominal (unknown) RL controller and onboard perception."
Feasibility Analysis of real-time Robustness Certification.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246579,"The robustness certification of deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial in many safety-critical domains. Randomized Smoothing (RS) has emerged as the current state-of-the-art method for DNN robustness verification that successfully scales on large DNNs used in practice, has achieved excellent results, and has been extended for a large variety of adversarial perturbation scenarios. However, an important cost in RS is during inference, since it requires passing tens or hundreds of thousands of perturbed samples through the DNN to perform the verification. In this work we aim to address this, and explore what happens as we decrease the number of samples by orders of magnitude, and the effect on the certified radius. Surprisingly, we find that the performance reduction in terms of average certified radius is not too large, even if we decrease the number of samples by two orders of magnitude, or more. Moreover, we find that the resulting certified radius reduction can be mitigated using off-the-self methods designed to improve RS performance. This can pave the way for dramatically faster robustness certification, unlocking the possibility of performing it in real-time, which we demonstrate. We perform a detailed analysis, both theoretically and experimentally, and show promising results on the standard CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets."
Design and Flight Control of a Novel Thrust-Vectored Tricopter Using Twisting and Tilting Rotors.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247693,"This paper presents a novel, compact overactuated tricopter featuring a servo-driven twisting and tilting mechanism, preventing the adverse effects of internal force contradiction during flight. Each armâs vectored thrust is provided by a single motor, with the twisting and tilting angles controlled by two vertically mounted servos. These components are collectively mounted within a 3D-printed semi-ring structure, and are rigidly attached to the fuselage via carbon tubes at the twist end. To address the asymmetry inherent in the tricopter configuration, we conducted a qualitative analysis of the disturbances introduced by the actuators. Additionally, we emphasize the need to include gyroscopic torque effects caused by arm rotations. This issue is addressed using a control allocation method, with our proposed improved Force Decomposition (FD)-based iteration offering a low-cost computational solution. The dynamic models of the motion of rotational joints, identified and employed as virtual sensors, contribute to the estimation of the improved control effective matrix. This overactuated tricopter can operate like a conventional rotorcraft, with the added capability of achieving attitude adjustments through manual control inputs. Finally, we demonstrate the tricopterâs advantages by comparing simulations and flight experiments, both with and without the application of the improved method."
Online Anti-Swing Trajectory Refinement for Variable-Length Cable-Suspended Aerial Transportation Robot.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246841,"Aerial robots have demonstrated significant potential in suspended cargo transportation, especially in industries such as logistics and food delivery. Due to the underactuated and nonlinear dynamics of the cable-suspended system, directly tracking a given trajectory with a multicopter without modifying its controller often leads to significant payload swing. This compromises the safety and stability of the cargo. To address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes an online trajectory refinement method for a variable-length cable-suspended aerial transportation robot, independent from the control layer. By incorporating payload swing angle information, the reference trajectory is refined in real-time, effectively suppressing payload oscillations during transportation. Specially, Lyapunov techniques and LaSalleâs invariance theorem are employed to rigorously guarantee the feasibility of the designed trajectory refinement scheme. Finally, hardware experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the refined trajectory not only enables precise positioning of the multicopter, but also effectively suppresses payload oscillations during transportation, significantly enhancing the safety and reliability of the aerial cargo delivery."
Differential-Flatness-Based Tracking Control for Tractor-Trailers in Reversing Maneuvers.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247665,"In this paper, we propose a differential-flatness-based controller (DFBC) for precise trajectory tracking of tractor-trailers, particularly during reversing maneuvers, which are challenging due to unstable equilibrium points. The proposed controller leverages the differential flatness property of tractor-trailers, equivalently transforming the nonlinear kinematics into a brunovsky canonical form, allowing the application of linear control theory for control design. Compared to traditional linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controllers, the proposed DFBC method achieves higher precision and robustness in reversing maneuvers. We also showcase the performance of the proposed DFBC method through physical experiments conducted on our self-developed 1/10 scale autonomous tractor-trailer."
Steering Elongate Multi-legged Robots by Modulating Body Undulation Waves.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246477,"Centipedes exhibit great maneuverability in diverse environments due to their many legs and body-driven control. By leveraging similar morphologies and control strategies, their robotic counterparts also demonstrate effective terrestrial locomotion. However, the success of these multi-legged robots is largely limited to forward locomotion; steering is substantially less studied, in part because of the difficulty in coordinating a high degree-of-freedom robot to follow predictable, planar trajectories. To resolve these challenges, we take inspiration from control schemes based on geometric mechanics(GM) in elongate systemsâ locomotion through highly damped environments. We model the elongate, multi-legged system as a ""terrestrial swimmer"" in highly frictional environments and implement steering schemes derived from low-order templates. We identify an effective turning strategy by superimposing two traveling waves of lateral body undulation and further explore variations of the ""turning wave"" to enable a spectrum of arc-following steering primitives. We test our hypothesized modulation scheme on a robophysical model and validate steering trajectories against theoretically predicted displacements producing steering radii between 0 and 0.6 body length. We then apply our control framework to Ground Control Roboticsâ elongate multi-legged robot, Major Tom, using these motion primitives to autonomously navigate around obstacles and corners on indoor and outdoor terrain. Our work creates a systematic framework for controlling these highly mobile devices in the plane using a low-order model based on sequences of body shape changes."
An Intelligent Skeleton Based on Liquid Metal for Biohybrid Actuator Powered by Muscle.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246112,"Biological machines that use biological cells and soft materials in combination to obtain a sense of the environment driven by bioenergy and generate driving force are called biohybrid actuators. With the development of tissue engineering and organoid technology, researchers have applied biohybrid actuators technology to the research of precision medicine and targeted drug delivery, but the research on feedback and evaluation of biohybrid actuation performance is limited to visual and simulation calculations. Therefore, we hope to develop an intelligent crawling skeleton for sensing function, which can be used to evaluate the actuation ability of muscle actuators, and eventually realize the high-precision control of biohybrid actuators. In this work, an intelligent crawling skeleton based on three-dimensional liquid metal is proposed to detect and feedback the crawling of C2C12 muscle actuators. Three-dimensional muscle tissue was composed of mixing hydrogels and cells, and the functionalization of muscle rings was promoted using static mechanical forces and external electric field stimulation. The composite crawling skeleton is fabricated by inverting mold and soft lithography technology. The skeleton can adapt to large deformations above 90 degrees and is more sensitive to deformations by adjusting materials with different elastic modulus. Inspired by the tendon-bone structure, the intelligent crawling skeleton can obtain the deformation degree of the biohybrid actuator in the crawling process according to the characteristics of the deformation from the muscle tissue, and put forward a good idea for the feedback and closed-loop control of the biohybrid actuators."

A dynamic mechanical characterization technique with serially connected microchannels simulates malignant tumor cell deformation and migration in vivo, enabling precise identification of three malignant tumor cell lines and three normal cell lines through consecutive compressions. High-speed imaging combined with computer vision and image processing techniques facilitates rapid and accurate automated analysis for tumor cells.

In this work, a technology that combines lateral-field optoelectronic tweezers (LOET) with electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is used to separate cells into single cells and then encapsulate each single cell within an individual droplet, generating single-cell droplets. More importantly, it also enables the control of the microenvironment of the separated single cells. The driving control of the single - cell droplets is achieved through the EWOD, which has good application prospects in the field of single- cell research."
Achieving Lift-to-Weight Ratio >3.5 in Piezoelectric Direct-Driven Insect-Scale Flapping-Wing MAVs.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247553,"Insect-scale flapping-wing micro aerial vehicles (FWMAVs) employing piezoelectric direct-drive configurations eliminate traditional kinematic chains through direct coupling of the wing and actuator. While this design approach significantly reduces structural complexity and manufacturing costs compared to transmission-dependent systems, it inherently limits wing stroke amplitude and consequent lift generation. This paper presents a novel lift-enhancement strategy for piezoelectric direct-drive FWMAVs, effectively improving payload capacity through optimized aerodynamic performance. The redesigned X-configuration prototype demonstrates outstanding metrics: 68 mm wingspan with 212 mg total mass achieves 7.47 mN maximum lift (exceeding 3.5:1 lift-to-weight ratio) and 1.25 m/s takeoff speed.

Dual-Mode Motion Control of Multi-Stimulus Deformable Miniature Robots with Adaptive Orientation Compensation in Unstructured Environments.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247746,"Miniature robots hold great promise for performing micromanipulation tasks within hard-to-reach confined spaces. However, effectively maneuvering across complex and unstructured terrain, achieving adaptive morphogenesis, and developing adaptive multimodal locomotion strategies remain challenges for these robotic systems. Here, we develop a multi-stimulus-responsive deformable miniature robot integrated with an adaptive multimodal motion control method. Sodium alginate hydrogel and graphene-coated magnetic elastomer are integrated into the sheet-shaped robot to enable responsiveness to temperature, humidity, and magnetic fields. A kinematic gait model is designed to control oscillatory motion in the semi-contracted state and rotational motion in the fully contracted state of the miniature robot. To automatically mitigate angular deviation between the robot's motion direction and the intended path, an adaptive orientation compensation control algorithm based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed robot exhibits capabilities for flexible and accurate navigation within unstructured environments (e.g., rock piles and stomach models), and is further shown to be capable of cargo transport. The proposed adaptive morphogenesis robots, enabled by dual-mode motion control, hold significant potential for targeted delivery and other micromanipulation applications in complex, unstructured, and confined environments."
Enhanced Rolling Motion of Magnetic Microparticles by Turning Interface Lubrication.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11245921,"Micro-nano robots must break the symmetry of the flow field to generate net displacement in the low Reynolds number environment. The spherical micro-robots utilize the frictional forces generated through interaction with the surface. We designed a magnetic microroller robot powered by the rotating AC magnetic field. Here, we employed dual measurements of laser ranging and computer vision to demonstrate that a single 100 Î¼m microroller maintains a lubrication film of 1 to 15 Î¼m with the surface during normal motion. We found that the translational velocity of the microroller is correlated with the lubrication film thickness. Based on the robot's gravity, we controlled an additional downward gradient magnetic field to effectively increase the load of robot and reduce the lubrication film thickness, thereby controllably increasing the translational velocity of the robot. For example, the gradient magnetic field generated by superimposing a 30mA direct current input can reduce the lubrication film thickness from 8 Î¼m to 4 Î¼m in a 10 Hz rotating magnetic field, and increase the translational velocity from 230 Î¼m/s to 460 Î¼m/s. The enhancement of the robot's motion performance enables it to better control its movement in fluids. Finally, we validated the strategy for controllable acceleration of micro-scale particles rolling on surfaces, applied to control fluid motion in multiple arteries within blood vessels.

Dynamic Risk-Aware MPPI for Mobile Robots in Crowds via Efficient Monte Carlo Approximations.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246822,"Deploying mobile robots safely among humans requires the motion planner to account for the uncertainty in the other agentsâ predicted trajectories. This remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI), a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPIâs gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function. Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles demonstrate DRA-MPPIâs superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), FrenÃ©t planner, and vanilla MPPI.

Motion Planning and Control with Unknown Nonlinear Dynamics through Predicted Reachability.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11245807,"Autonomous motion planning under unknown nonlinear dynamics presents significant challenges. An agent needs to continuously explore the system dynamics to acquire its properties, such as reachability, in order to guide system navigation adaptively. In this paper, we propose a hybrid planning-control framework designed to compute a feasible trajectory toward a target. Our approach involves partitioning the state space and approximating the system by a piecewise affine (PWA) system with constrained control inputs. By abstracting the PWA system into a directed weighted graph, we incrementally update the existence of its edges via affine system identification and reach control theory, introducing a predictive reachability condition by exploiting prior information of the unknown dynamics. Heuristic weights are assigned to edges based on whether their existence is certain or remains indeterminate. Consequently, we propose a framework that adaptively collects and analyzes data during mission execution, continually updates the predictive graph, and synthesizes a controller online based on the graph search outcomes. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulation scenarios involving a mobile robot operating in unknown terrains, with its unknown dynamics abstracted as a single integrator model."

By learning separate distance fields for each link and combining them through the kinematics chain, the learned N-CSDF provides an accurate and computationally efficient representation of the robotâs shape. The key advantage of a distance function representation of a continuum robot is that it enables efficient collision checking for motion planning in dynamic and cluttered environments, even with point-cloud observations. We integrate the N-CSDF into a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller to generate safe trajectories for multi-segment continuum robots. The proposed approach is validated for continuum robots with various links in several simulated environments with static and dynamic obstacles."
Reactive Model Predictive Contouring Control for Robot Manipulators.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247346,"This contribution presents a robot path-following framework via Reactive Model Predictive Contouring Control (RMPCC) that successfully avoids obstacles, singularities and self-collisions in dynamic environments at 100 Hz. Many path-following methods rely on the time parametrization, but struggle to handle collision and singularity avoidance while adhering kinematic limits or other constraints. Specifically, the error between the desired path and the actual position can become large when executing evasive maneuvers. Thus, this paper derives a method that parametrizes the reference path by a path parameter and performs the optimization via RMPCC. In particular, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are introduced to avoid collisions and singularities in dynamic environments. A Jacobian-based linearization and Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation enable solving the nonlinear RMPCC problem at 100 Hz, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a factor of 10. Experiments confirm that the framework handles dynamic obstacles in real-world settings with low contouring error and low robot acceleration."

Deep Coarse-to-Fine Networks for Robust Segmentation and Pose Estimation of Surgical Suturing Threads.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246693,"Autonomous suturing is a critical challenge in robot-assisted surgery, where accurate segmentation and pose estimation of suturing threads are essential prerequisites. However, suturing threads are easily occluded by moving instruments and embedded in deformable tissues which make the task much more challenging. To address this, we propose a coarse-to-fine network for detailed segmentation and pose estimation of suturing threads. The coarse stage aims to capture global thread structure, while the fine stage refines the detailed structure through error residual correction. A spatial context fusion module is incorporated to improve the perception of occluded regions, and weighted balanced cross entropy loss as well as hard sample mining strategy is implemented to enhance small target segmentation performance. To deal with severe occlusions, topological constraints are utilized to effectively identify and reconstruct invisible thread segments. Experiments have been conducted on three datasets collected from different surgical scenes including phantom, endoscopy, and microsurgery.

Directed Spatial Consistency-Based Partial-to-Partial Point Cloud Registration with Deep Graph Matching.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247344,"3D point cloud registration is an essential problem in computer vision, robotics, surgical navigation and augmented reality. Accurate registration of partially overlapped intraoperative point clouds (e.g., femoral reconstruction) remains critical yet challenging in orthopedic navigation due to incomplete overlap and dynamic noise. In this study, we propose a partial-to-partial point cloud registration framework based on directional spatial consistency. First, we extract overlapped areas from partially overlapping point clouds and leverage the point registration graph matching module to calculate the hard point matching matrix. Second, we sample nodes from the source point cloud and generate translation-invariant edge vectors (direction/scale-preserving) via their k-nearest neighbors, guided by predicted point correspondences. This bypasses translation ambiguities by encoding spatial consistency through edges, reducing pose estimation to 3DoF alignment (rotation). The loss explicitly couples point-level matches with edge-level geometric constraints for dual optimization. Building upon this framework, we extract reliable overlapping edge representations and prune their similarity matrix by thresholding low-confidence scores, effectively suppressing spurious matches. The proposed edge-aware matching mechanism further exploits the translation invariance of local structures to refine point correspondences with enhanced accuracy. Finally, we introduce a bidirectional registration mechanism to reinforce optimization stability, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks.

Revisiting 3D Curve to Surface Registration using Tangent and Normal Vectors for Computer-Assisted Orthopedic Surgery.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246570,"In this paper, we present a novel curve-to-surface registration method, termed Bi-directional Hybrid Mixture Model Registration based on Dual-constrained Tangent and Normal Vectors (BiHMM-DTN), where two different tangent vectors at the intraoperative point are simultaneously used with the normal vector at the corresponding preoperative point to construct the geometric constraints. While hybrid registration models incorporating tangent and normal vectors (HMM-TN) demonstrate success, their geometric constraints prove inadequate or inappropriate for sparse intraoperative point sets, frequently yielding suboptimal optimization outcomes. By critically revisiting the geometric constraints of HMM-TN, we propose a dual-constraints-based hybrid mixture model registration framework with enhanced intraoperative point set acquisition protocols. To deal with noise and outliers in preoperative and intraoperative point setsâcaused by reconstruction inaccuracies and tracking errors, respectivelyâour approach employs a bi-directional registration mechanism for curve-to-surface registration. We provide rigorous proofs validating the geometric completeness of the dual constraints within this mechanism. The BiHMM-DTN framework is formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem and optimized using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Furthermore, to enhance convergence stability and accelerate optimization, the rotation matrix is updated iteratively through successive incremental steps. Extensive experiments on human femur and hip models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, including both traditional optimization and deep learning methods, under various noise and outlier conditions. Furthermore, real-world phantom experiments highlight the potential clinical value of our method for surgical navigation applications.

Gaussian Splatting with Reflectance Regularization for Endoscopic Scene Reconstruction.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247248,"Endoscopic reconstruction plays a crucial role in surgical robotics. The dynamic lighting conditions and integrated camera-light source in endoscopic scenes create a distinct reconstruction challenge: shape ambiguity. To mitigate this, we propose a Gaussian Splatting (GS) based framework for endoscopic scene reconstruction, enhanced with reflectance regularization. We embed every 3D Gaussian point with physical reflective attributes and combine this representation with a physically based inverse rendering framework. By jointly training 3DGS for view synthesis with this reflectance regularization, we are able to attain high-quality geometry without changing the volume rendering pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority in both geometry representation and rendering performance compared to existing GS approaches, making it a practical solution for endoscopic applications.

Diffusion Policies for Risk-Averse Behavior Modeling in Offline Reinforcement Learning.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11245819,"Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents distinct challenges as it relies solely on observational data. A central concern in this context is ensuring the safety of the learned policy by quantifying uncertainties associated with various actions and environmental stochasticity. Traditional approaches primarily emphasize mitigating epistemic uncertainty by learning risk-averse policies, often overlooking environmental stochasticity. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware distributional offline RL method to simultaneously address both epistemic uncertainty and environmental stochasticity. We propose a model-free offline RL algorithm capable of learning risk-averse policies and characterizing the entire distribution of discounted cumulative rewards, as opposed to merely maximizing the expected value of accumulated discounted returns. Our method is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments in both risk-sensitive and risk-neutral benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance."
IHGSL: Interpretable Heuristic Graph Structure Learning for Multi-Robot Autonomous Collaborative Systems.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246258,"In multi-robot systems, capturing the complex and dynamic interaction relationships is essential for enhancing autonomous collaboration. However, existing learning-based approaches usually overlook the understanding of these relationships, leading to reliability issues and hindering their application to real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel approach called Interpretable Heuristic Graph Structure Learning (IHGSL) to better comprehend the complex collaborative relationships in multi-robot systems. We first construct a predicate space to define diverse predicates that express fundamental relationships. Then we employ the variational information bottleneck technique to acquire a latent representation of the current observation by aligning it with the historical trajectory. On this basis, the predicates that the robot should currently focus on the most are learned, and some interaction relationships are established accordingly. Thereby an interpretable relationship graph is generated heuristically to guide the achievement of multi-robot autonomous collaborative decision-making. Through experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the process of relationship inference, thus validating the interpretability of IHGSL. Compared with existing methods, IHGSL also achieves superior collaboration performance, which highlights the effectiveness of the learned heuristic graph structure."
ACGD: Visual Multitask Policy Learning with Asymmetric Critic Guided Distillation.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247025,"We present Asymmetric Critic Guided Distillation, ACGD, a framework for learning multi-task dexterous manipulation policies that can manipulate articulated objects using images as input. ACGD is a scalable student-teacher distillation approach that utilizes behavior cloning to distill multiple expert policies into a single vision-based, multi-task student policy for dexterous manipulation. The expert policies are trained with traditional RL techniques with access to privileged state information of both the robot and the manipulated object, while the distilled student policy operates under realistic sensory constraints, specifically using only camera images and robot proprioception. During distillation, we use an expert-critic that provides action labels and value estimates to refine the studentâs action sampling through a dual IL/RL objective. In the multi-task setting, we achieve this through an aggregate critic for different single-task experts. Our approach exhibits strong performance compared to a number of state-of-the-art imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) baselines. We evaluate across a variety of multi-task dexterous manipulation benchmarks including bimanual manipulation, single-hand object articulation tasks, and a tendon-actuated hand and achieves state-of-the-art performance with 10-15% improvement over the baseline algorithms.

GACL: Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning with Active Task and Performance Monitoring.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246910,"Curriculum learning has emerged as a promising approach for training complex robotics tasks, yet current applications predominantly rely on manually designed curricula, which demand significant engineering effort and can suffer from subjective and suboptimal human design choices. While automated curriculum learning has shown success in simple domains like grid worlds and games where task distributions can be easily specified, robotics tasks present unique challenges: they require handling complex task spaces while maintaining relevance to target domain distributions that are only partially known through limited samples. To this end, we propose Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning (GACL<sup>1</sup>), a framework specifically designed for robotics curriculum learning with three key innovations: (1) a task representation that consistently handles complex robot task design, (2) an active performance tracking mechanism that allows adaptive curriculum generation appropriate for the robotâs current capabilities, and (3) a grounding approach that maintains target domain relevance through alternating sampling between reference and synthetic tasks. We validate GACL on wheeled navigation in constrained environments and quadruped locomotion in challenging 3D confined spaces, achieving 6.8% and 6.1% higher success rates, respectively, than state-of-the-art methods in each domain."
RT-HCP: Dealing with Inference Delays and Sample Efficiency to Learn Directly on Robotic Platforms.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247277,"Learning a controller directly on the robot requires extreme sample efficiency. Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods are the most sample efficient, but they often suffer from a too long inference time to meet the robot control frequency requirements. In this paper, we address the sample efficiency and inference time challenges with two contributions. First, we define a general framework to deal with inference delays where the slow inference robot controller provides a sequence of actions to feed the control-hungry robotic platform without execution gaps. Then, we compare several RL algorithms in the light of this framework and propose RT-HCP, an algorithm that offers an excellent trade-off between performance, sample efficiency and inference time. We validate the superiority of RT-HCP with experiments where we learn a controller directly on a simple but high frequency FURUTA pendulum platform. Code: github.com/elasriz/RTHCP"
DRARL: Disengagement-Reason-Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Improvement of Autonomous Driving Policy.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246116,"With the increasing presence of automated vehicles on open roads under driver supervision, disengagement cases are becoming more prevalent. While some data-driven planning systems attempt to directly utilize these disengagement cases for policy improvement, the inherent scarcity of disengagement data (often occurring as a single instance) restricts training effectiveness. Furthermore, some disengagement data should be excluded since the disengagement may not always come from the failure of driving policies, e.g. the driver may casually intervene for a while. To this end, this work proposes disengagement-reason-augmented reinforcement learning (DRARL), which enhances driving policy improvement process according to the reason of disengagement cases. Specifically, the reason of disengagement is identified by an out-of-distribution (OOD) state estimation model. When the reason doesnât exist, the case will be identified as a casual disengagement case, which doesnât require additional policy adjustment. Otherwise, the policy can be updated under a reason-augmented imagination environment, improving the policy performance of disengagement cases with similar reasons. The method is evaluated using real-world disengagement cases collected by autonomous driving robotaxi. Experimental results demonstrate that the method accurately identifies policy-related disengagement reasons, allowing the agent to handle both original and semantically similar cases through reason-augmented training. Furthermore, the approach prevents the agent from becoming overly conservative after policy adjustments. Overall, this work provides an efficient way to improve driving policy performance with disengagement cases."

This paper introduces LR<sup>2</sup>Depth, a novel MDE method that addresses this challenge by utilizing large-kernel convolution on low-resolution feature maps for efficient large-region feature aggregation. Our approach leverages the fact that each pixel on low-resolution feature maps corresponds to a larger region of the original image, allowing for fast and accurate depth predictions at a lower inference cost. Extensive experiments on NYU-Depth-V2, KITTI, and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate that LR<sup>2</sup>Depth not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also operates approximately twice as fast as previous MDE methods.

Adjacent-view Transformers for Supervised Surround-view Depth Estimation.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246758,"Depth estimation has been widely studied and serves as the fundamental step of 3D perception for robotics and autonomous driving. Though significant progress has been made in monocular depth estimation in the past decades, these attempts are mainly conducted on the KITTI benchmark with only front-view cameras, which ignores the correlations across surround-view cameras. In this paper, we propose an Adjacent-View Transformer for Supervised Surround-view Depth estimation (AVT-SSDepth), to jointly predict the depth maps across multiple surrounding cameras. Specifically, we employ a global-to-local feature extraction module that combines CNN with transformer layers for enriched representations. Further, the adjacent-view attention mechanism is proposed to enable the intra-view and inter-view feature propagation. The former is achieved by the self-attention module within each view, while the latter is realized by the adjacent attention module, which computes the attention across multi-cameras to exchange the multi-scale representations across surround-view feature maps. In addition, AVT-SSDepth has strong cross-dataset generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods on both DDAD and nuScenes datasets.

Monocular One-Shot Metric-Depth Alignment for RGB-Based Robot Grasping.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247354,"Accurate 6D object pose estimation is a prerequisite for successfully completing robotic prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation tasks. At present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision, which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras), and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a novel framework, monocular one-shot metric-depth alignment, MOMA, to recover metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Real-world experiments on tabletop 2-finger grasping and suction-based bin-picking applications show MOMA achieves high success rates in diverse tasks, confirming its effectiveness."
Learning-based Keypoints Detection with Topological Order on Deformable Linear Objects from Incomplete Point Clouds.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246954,"Detection of deformable linear objects (DLOs) in three-dimensional space is essential for robotic manipulation of DLOs.

To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning-based method that leverages the topological properties of DLOs to robustly detect keypoints from incomplete point clouds while preserving the topological order of keypoints. Our approach initializes a sequence of keypoints that adheres to the topological structure of DLOs. Then, these ordered keypoints are refined through bidirectional sequence learning. Simulation results demonstrate that our method generates accurate, uniform, and smooth keypoint sequences under varying levels of occlusion. Compared to existing baselines, our approach achieves superior performance. Real-world experiments further validate the generalization capability of our method in unseen and challenging scenarios involving occlusion and self-occlusion while maintaining real-time performance."
Self-Supervised Enhancement for Depth from a Lightweight ToF Sensor with Monocular Images.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246529,"Depth map enhancement using paired high-resolution RGB images offers a cost-effective solution for improving low-resolution depth data from lightweight ToF sensors.

To address this, we propose a self-supervised learning framework, SelfToF, which generates detailed and scale-aware depth maps. Starting from an image-based self-supervised depth estimation pipeline, we add low-resolution depth as inputs, design a new depth consistency loss, propose a scale-recovery module, and finally obtain a large performance boost. Furthermore, since the ToF signal sparsity varies in real-world applications, we upgrade SelfToF to SelfToF* with submanifold convolution and guided feature fusion. Consequently, SelfToF* maintain robust performance across varying sparsity levels in ToF data. Overall, our proposed method is both efficient and effective, as verified by extensive experiments on the NYU and ScanNet datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/denyingmxd/selftof."
TCNet: A Temporally Consistent Network for Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246514,"Despite significant advances in self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods, achieving temporally consistent and accurate depth maps from frame sequences remains a formidable challenge. Existing approaches often estimate depth maps for individual frames in isolation, neglecting the rich geometric and temporal coherence present across frames. Consequently, this oversight leads to temporally inconsistent outputs, resulting in noticeable temporal flickering artifacts. In response, this paper presents TCNet, a Temporal Consistent Network for self-supervised monocular depth estimation. Specifically, we propose an Inter-frame Temporal Fusion (ITF) module to emphasize the influence of preceding images on the depth estimation of the current frame. The Temporal Consistency Loss (TCL) is proposed to leverage the temporal constraints between the depth maps of adjacent frames. Besides, TCNet can also be applied to both single-frame and multi-frame scenarios during inference. Experimental evaluations on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art depth estimation methods in accuracy and temporal consistency. Our code will be made public."
DPSN: Dual Prior Knowledge Induced Tactile paving and Obstacle Joint Segmentation Network.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246881,"Accurate semantic segmentation of both tactile paving and the obstacle is crucial for the safe mobility of visually impaired individuals. However, existing methods face two major challenges: (i) discontinuous segmentation fragments; (ii) Inaccurate obstacle recognition. To address challenge (i), we propose incorporating appearance priors of complete tactile pavings to prevent the model from directly learning irregular ground truth masks. To tackle challenge (ii), we propose introducing cross-modal semantic priors to complement the semantic information of obstacles. We implemented these strategies in proposed Dual Prior knowledge induced tactile paving and obstacle joint Segmentation Network (DPSN). Based on bilateral network architecture, DPSN merges obstacle category masks into tactile paving categories, constructing a complete tactile paving mask. Utilizing the complete mask, DPSN transfer appearance prior knowledge to detail features from boundary and structural perspectives. Concurrently, DPSN leverages the CLIP Text Encoder to guide visual feature decoding by attention mechanisms, transferring rich cross-modal semantic prior knowledge to the visual feature maps. Furthermore, we propose the TPO-Dataset, the first dataset for joint tactile paving and obstacle segmentation acquired from actual scenes. Experiments demonstrate that DPSN achieves state-of-the-art results on the TPO-Dataset, with relative gains of 27.16% in obstacle IoU and 30.53% in accuracy metrics compared to baseline methods.

DCT-Diffusion: Depth Completion for Transparent Objects with Diffusion Denoising Approach.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247453,"Transparent objects are common in industrial automation and daily life. However, accurate visual perception of these objects remains challenging due to their reflective and refractive properties. Most previous studies fail to capture contextual information or typically rely on regression-based methods at the decoder stage, suffering from overfitting and unsatisfactory object details. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel depth completion framework for transparent objects with diffusion denoising approach (DCT-Diffusion). First, we adopt a transformer-based encoder to globally learn the depth relationships from different parts of the input by modeling long-distance dependencies. Then, we propose to introduce the diffusion model to generate refined depth maps from random depth distribution. Through iterative refinement, our model can progressively enhance depth map details and achieves fine-grained performance. Lastly, a conditioned fusion module is developed, which utilizes encoder features as visual conditions and fuses them with the denoising block at each step using augmented attention. Extensive comparative studies and cross-domain experiments prove that the DCT-Diffusion outperforms previous methods and significantly improves the robustness and generalization ability. Moreover, visualization results further illustrate that our method can generate depth maps with more complete geometry and clearer boundaries, achieving satisfactory results."
"Stimulating Imagination: Towards General-purpose ""Something Something Placement"".",https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11245844,"General-purpose object placement is a fundamental capability of an intelligent generalist robot: being capable of rearranging objects following precise human instructions even in novel environments. This work is dedicated to achieving general-purpose object placement with ""something something"" instructions. Specifically, we break the entire process down into three parts, including object localization, goal imagination and robot control, and propose a method named SPORT. SPORT leverages a pre-trained large vision model for broad semantic reasoning about objects, and learns a diffusion-based pose estimator to ensure physically-realistic results in 3D space. Only object types (movable or reference) are communicated between these two parts, which brings two benefits. One is that we can fully leverage the powerful ability of open-set object recognition and localization since no specific fine-tuning is needed for the robotic scenario. Moreover, the diffusion-based estimator only need to ""imagine"" the object poses after the placement, while no necessity for their semantic information. Thus the training burden is greatly reduced and no massive training is required. The training data for the goal pose estimation is collected in simulation and annotated by using GPT-4. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. SPORT can not only generate promising 3D goal poses for unseen simulated objects, but also be seamlessly applied to real-world settings."
DroneKey: Drone 3D Pose Estimation in Image Sequences using Gated Key-representation and Pose-adaptive Learning.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247556,"Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint detection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing methods.

Self-Distilled Stereo Matching: Real-Time Domain Generalization for Robotic Depth Perception.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246574,"While human vision inherently achieves robust cross-domain depth estimation through binocular coordination, robotic systems employing stereo matching still confront significant challenges in maintaining robustness across domains when performing real-time environmental depth perception. Furthermore, most stereo matching methods struggle with challenging regions such as object boundaries and non-overlapping areas on the left side of the left image, resulting in disparity maps that are relatively indistinct and lacking fine details. In this paper, we propose Learning More in Challenging Areas (LMC) to alleviate this problem, which enhances the domain generalization of the model through targeted training on challenging regions. LMC is a simple yet effective data-driven training framework primarily based on self-distillation. Specifically, 1) We pre-train models on a high-frequency dataset to improve perception ability on object boundaries; 2) We develop a self-distillation training strategy to benefit learning in non-overlapping areas on the left side of the left image; 3) We design an adaptive difficult area mask to balance the loss weight on other undefined challenging regions.

Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the objectâs geometry, we introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the networkâs ability to effectively represent the objectâs geometric information.

Among the methodologies employed in MAS, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) stands out as one of the most efficacious algorithms. However, when confronted with the complex objective of Formation Control with Collision Avoidance (FCCA): designing an effective reward function that facilitates swift convergence of the policy network to an optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that aims to overcome this challenge. By giving large language models (LLMs) on the prioritization of tasks and the observable information available to each agent, our framework generates reward functions that can be dynamically adjusted online based on evaluation outcomes by employing more advanced evaluation metrics rather than the rewards themselves. This mechanism enables the MAS to simultaneously achieve formation control and obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments with enhanced efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to reach superior performance levels.

However, it is the typical case that significant processing delays are encountered due to the voluminous amount of 3D points contained in each frame of the point cloud data. Furthermore, the inherently unstructured characteristics of point clouds poses challenges for integrating the latest deep learning advancements into point cloud data applications. To address these issues, this work proposes an annotation-free curb detection method leveraging Altitude Difference Image (ADI) (as shown in Fig. 1), which effectively mitigates the aforementioned challenges. Given that methods based on deep learning generally demand extensive, manually annotated datasets, which are both expensive and labor-intensive to create, we present an Automatic Curb Annotator (ACA) module. This module utilizes a deterministic curb detection algorithm to automatically generate a vast quantity of training data. Consequently, it facilitates the training of the curb detection model without necessitating any manual annotation of data. Finally, by incorporating a post-processing module, we manage to achieve state-of-the-art results on the KITTI 3D curb dataset [1] with considerably reduced processing delays compared to existing methods, which underscores the effectiveness of our approach in curb detection tasks.

R2LDM: An Efficient 4D Radar Super-Resolution Framework Leveraging Diffusion Model.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246739,"We introduce R2LDM, an innovative approach for generating dense and accurate 4D radar point clouds, guided by corresponding LiDAR point clouds. Instead of utilizing range images or birdâs eye view (BEV) images, we represent both LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds using voxel features, which more effectively capture 3D shape information. Subsequently, we propose the Latent Voxel Diffusion Model (LVDM), which performs the diffusion process in the latent space. Additionally, a novel Latent Point Cloud Reconstruction (LPCR) module is utilized to reconstruct point clouds from high-dimensional latent voxel features. As a result, R2LDM effectively generates LiDAR-like point clouds from paired raw radar data. We evaluate our approach on two different datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves 6- to 10-fold densification of radar point clouds, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in 4D radar point cloud super-resolution. Furthermore, the enhanced radar point clouds generated by our method significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving up to 31.7% improvement in point cloud registration recall rate and 24.9% improvement in object detection accuracy."
DGETP: Dynamic Graph Attention Network for Embodied Task Planning.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11245660,"With the development of embodied intelligence, many studies have made progress by incorporating scene graphs and GNN into task planning. However, most methods still face challenges in fully capturing the sequential relationships between agent actions and the environment, making it difficult to handle dynamic changes and complexity inherent in embodied tasks. This paper proposes a Dynamic Graph Attention Network for Embodied Task Planning (DGETP) to process scene graph sequences and robot graphs for dynamic environment perception. In DGETP, we design a Hierarchical Dynamic Graph Attention network (H-DGAT) by employing both structural and temporal attention mechanisms to model the dynamic evolution feature of the scene. A Dual-branch Action-object Predictor (DAP) is proposed in DGETP through introducing sequences of previous actions and objects to efficiently aggregate historical information. DAP captures temporal dependencies between past and future actions through explicit sequence modeling, and reduces prediction complexity via a dual-branch architecture that separates action and object prediction while preserving their correlations through targeted feature fusion. Experiments show that DGETP improves task accuracy by over 30% in seen scenes and over 15% in unseen scenes compared to other baselines. In complex scenes, DGETP demonstrates strong generalization ability. Finally, the simulation environment indicates that DGETP achieves more goals than most of the advanced task planning method."
Evidential Uncertainty Estimation for Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247741,"Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, yet uncertainty in agent behavior and perception noise makes it inherently challenging. While multi-modal trajectory prediction models generate multiple plausible future paths with associated probabilities, effectively quantifying uncertainty remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a novel multi-modal trajectory prediction approach based on evidential deep learning that estimates both positional and mode probability uncertainty in real time. Our approach leverages a Normal Inverse Gamma distribution for positional uncertainty and a Dirichlet distribution for mode uncertainty. Unlike sampling-based methods, it infers both types of uncertainty in a single forward pass, significantly improving efficiency. Additionally, we experimented with uncertainty-driven importance sampling to improve training efficiency by prioritizing underrepresented high-uncertainty samples over redundant ones. We perform extensive evaluations of our method on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets, demonstrating that it provides reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining high trajectory prediction accuracy."
Frontier Shepherding: A Bio-inspired Multi-robot Framework for Large-Scale Exploration.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246323,"Efficient exploration of large-scale environments remains a critical challenge in robotics, with applications ranging from environmental monitoring to search and rescue operations. This article proposes Frontier Shepherding (FroShe), a bio-inspired multi-robot framework for large-scale exploration. The framework heuristically models frontier exploration based on the shepherding behavior of herding dogs, where frontiers are treated as a swarm of sheep reacting to robots modeled as shepherding dogs. FroShe is robust across varying environment sizes and obstacle densities, requiring minimal parameter tuning for deployment across multiple agents. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method performs consistently, regardless of environment complexity, and outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies by an average of 20% with three UAVs. The approach was further validated in real-world experiments using single-and dual-drone deployments in a forest-like environment."
Multimodal Upstream Motion of Magnetically Controlled Micro/Nano Robots in High-Viscosity Fluids.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246297,"The efficacy of targeted cancer drug therapy is significantly compromised by imprecise drug delivery mechanisms. Micro/nano robots (MNRs), characterized by their controllable motion, present a promising solution to this challenge. However, the non-Newtonian nature of blood, with its high viscosity and blood cellsâ interference, poses substantial limitations on the upstream efficiency of MNRs. This paper innovatively discusses for the first time the effects of blood viscosity and blood cell interference on the motion of MNRs, investigating their upstream motion capabilities in blood through comprehensive theoretical modeling, simulation, and experimental validation. A dynamic model of MNR motion was developed, and the velocity formula for MNRs in non-Newtonian fluid was derived. Experiments were conducted using different magnetic fields in pure water, high-viscosity simulated blood, and diluted blood. Results indicated that under a gradient magnetic field, the upstream velocities of MNRs in pure water, simulated blood, and diluted blood were 45.0, 14.4, and 11.1 mm/s, respectively. Under a rotating magnetic field, the velocities of vortex swarms were 825, 240, and 145 Âµm/s, respectively. Increased fluid viscosity reduced MNR velocity by 70%, while blood cells caused an additional 10% reduction. This research establishes a theoretical and experimental framework for the upstream motion of MNRs against blood flow, enhancing their potential in targeted drug delivery and broader biomedical applications."
A Spatiotemporal Downwash Modeling for Agile Close-Proximity Multirotor Flight.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247247,"Accurate aerodynamic interaction modeling in multi-drone tasks is crucial for enhancing system stability and efficiency, especially when facing major disturbances from downwash wake effects. Conventional data-driven and empirical models mainly address simplified cases where one drone hovers or all vehicles have low absolute and relative velocities (â¤ 0.5 m/s), and rely merely on relative states. In this study, we use high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to explore quadrotor interactions at higher speeds (0.5-4.0 m/s). We find that as the absolute velocities of the UAVs rise, downwash effects change significantly. To account for these discrepancies, we present a data-driven model considering both the absolute and relative properties of the downwash problem. We propose a geometric deep neural network predictor and compare its performance with existing data-driven and empirical models. Validations on two quadrotor settings show that our model gives more reliable predictions in tough scenarios and performs better in training without rigorous fine-tuning. Finally, we combine our predictor with a nonlinear feedback controller to enhance flight control under downwash disturbances. However, we encounter limitations for our speed ranges during trajectory tracking such as delays and velocity loss. Despite these challenges, our encoding and prediction method shows to be a promising step to address the downwash effects at higher speeds.We release our dataset, method, and re-implementations at: https://github.com/pavelkharitenko/flare-dw."
Modeling Deception in Multi-Robot Target-Attacker-Defender Game via Deep Reinforcement Learning.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246010,"Deception is a crucial strategy in adversarial scenarios, yet its application in multi-agent confrontations remains understudied. This paper investigates deception in a multi-robot Target-Attacker-Defender (MR-TAD) game, where Attackers aim to capture Targets while evading Defenders. To model deception effectively, we propose a hierarchical decision-making framework that integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for high-level deceptive strategies and optimal control for low-level motion control. Furthermore, we introduce a novel composite deception-oriented reward function, which combines hitting rewards, belief switch rewards, and position advantage rewards to facilitate the training of deceptive behaviors. Simulation results across varying numbers of robots demonstrate that incorporating deception significantly increases the success rate of Attackers, with an average improvement of over 70% compared to non-deceptive strategies. Additionally, real-world experiments with omnidirectional mobile robots further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. This study establishes a generalizable framework for modeling deception in multi-agent systems, with potential applications in various multi-agent scenarios."

Traditional discrete systems struggle with rough terrain due to limited individual mobility, while modular systemsâwhere rigid, controllable constraints link robot unitsâimprove traversal but suffer from high control complexity and reduced flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Robot System with Controllable Weak Constraints (MRS-CWC), where robot units are connected by constraints with dynamically adjustable stiffness. This adaptive mechanism softens or stiffens in real time during environmental interactions, ensuring a balance between flexibility and mobility. We formulate the systemâs dynamics and control model and evaluate MRS-CWC against six baseline methods and an ablation variant in a benchmark dataset with 100 different simulation terrains. Results show that MRS-CWC achieves the highest navigation completion rate and ranks second in success rate, efficiency, and energy cost in the highly rugged terrain group, outperforming all baseline methods without relying on environmental modeling, path planning, or complex control. Even where MRS-CWC ranks second, its performance is only slightly behind a more complex ablation variant with environmental modeling and path planning.

A Two-Stage Swarm Planning Framework for Efficient Multi-Drone Waypoint Traversal.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247604,"The multi-drone waypoint traversal has significant potential for aerial robot swarms in various applications. However, it still faces challenges including low time efficiency, susceptibility to local minima, poor resilience to external disturbances, high computational complexity, and high communication burden. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage swarm planning framework by integrating an offline global trajectory generator and an online distributed local trajectory planner. This approach not only ensures time-optimality but also enhances resistance to external disturbances. Specifically, a complementary progress constraint (CPC)-based global trajectory planning method is first presented to generate globally optimal reference trajectories. Then, by taking these trajectories as global guidance, a local planner is designed to guarantee collision-free traversal. In the local planner, we present a distributed local re-planning algorithm by embedding the positional constraints constructed by Voronoi diagrams into the model predictive contouring control (MPCC). The drones only exchange their position information, significantly reducing the communication load. Additionally, the Voronoi-based spatial constraints allow the swarms to eliminate the collision risk caused by asynchronous communication. To reduce onboard computational resource requirements, the local planner adopts the real-time iteration (RTI) technique, executing the optimization only once per control cycle. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of waypoint tracking accuracy, safety, and global time optimality."

Based on the interaction graph and swarm trajectory, we use behavioral cloning to learn the control policy of the swarm system. To demonstrate the practicality of CBC, we deploy it on a real-world decentralized vision-based robot swarm system. A visual attention network is trained based on the learned interaction graph for online neighbor selection. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous approaches in predicting both the interaction graph and swarm actions with higher accuracy.

A Multimodal Neural Network for Recognizing Subjective Self-Disclosure Towards Social Robots.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246044,"Subjective self-disclosure is an important feature of human social interaction. While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature to characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure, little work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are able to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to model specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners. It is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction with and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In this paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based on models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a large self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss function, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both classification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that the best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1 score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model.

However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it fuses natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task. Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D occupancy grounding through multimodal learning. It combines visual, textual, and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a grounding head for refining localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting model performance.

In this study, we aim to automatically detect such anomalies in human-robot interactions by creating a dataset and developing anomaly detection models. To this end, we created a dataset by manually annotating videos of in-the-wild interactions collected from our field experiment designed to test a framework of parallel conversations in which a human intervenes when a problem occurs in the interaction. Using this dataset, we trained classification models to construct anomaly detection models. We then conducted another field experiment in which the modelâs detection results were presented as alerts to operators within the parallel conversation framework. The results confirmed that providing alerts on the basis of the anomaly detection model was useful for facilitating operator intervention."

Emergency Avoidance: Model Predictive Control Based Path Tracking for Unmanned Ground Vehicles with Active Obstacle Avoidance.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246956,"Autonomous driving is a high-performance, safety-critical task. Effectively controlling autonomous vehicles to enhance both performance and safety is crucial, especially in complex and dynamic environments. However, in real-time obstacle avoidance (OA) scenarios, the planning layer often fails due to high computational complexity and response delays. This trade-off between computational efficiency and safety performance presents a key challenge: how to achieve an optimal balance between autonomous driving safety and real-time performance. In recent years, addressing OA at the control layer has become a major research focus for improving the safety of autonomous vehicles.

Bridging the Reality Gap: Communication-Aware Task Allocation with Multi-Objective Asynchronous Policy Learning.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246981,"Distributed task allocation in the UAV swarm is sensitive to excessive communication overhead and frequent transmissions. Combining reinforcement learning and task allocation demonstrates great potential in enhancing algorithm performance and optimizing communication.

This paper proposes the Communication-Aware Task Allocation, which aims to train a gating mechanism policy to coordinate the transmission timing, improving robustness and timelessness of the task allocation. First, the policy learning problem is formalized as a POMDP, for which the channel access and other features are designed for observations, actions are inter-agent adaptive gating mechanisms, and the shared reward reflects global task conflicts. Second, to address the asynchronous learning under the CTDE, an asynchronous experience collection and splicing method is proposed to align trajectories. Then, the MOCPPO is proposed, which combines a primal-dual operator with proximal policy optimization, updating the optimal Lagrange multiplier and strategy parameters to simultaneously minimize task conflicts and communication overhead.

MGPRL: Distributed Multi-Gaussian Processes for Wi-Fi-based Multi-Robot Relative Localization in Large Indoor Environments.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247180,"Relative localization is a crucial capability for multi-robot systems operating in GPS-denied environments. Existing approaches for multi-robot relative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like cameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high computational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint environments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull of multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware multi-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based alignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI field of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are utilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative localization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations with that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with limited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi RSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or offline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed MGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments, comparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase that MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and computational efficiency."
Impact of Heterogeneous UWB Sensor Noise on the Optimality and Sensitivity of Mobile Positioning Systems.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247384,"In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for designing a multi-robot formation equipped with Ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors to localize a target robot. In the presence of noisy range measurements, the accuracy of the target robotâs pose estimation is highly dependent on the chosen formation geometry. Different from existing works, we account for the heterogeneous standard deviations of range measurements across different UWB transmitter-receiver pairs. We establish new optimality conditions for formation geometries and conduct a sensitivity analysis of optimal formations under robot positioning errors. In a 2D setting, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for both optimality and robustness to robot positioning uncertainty. Experimental results confirm the heterogeneous standard deviations of UWB range measurements and validate the target robotâs confidence ellipse model. An experimental comparison of formation geometries, optimized with and without considering heterogeneous noise, emphasizes the importance of accounting for the heterogeneous standard deviations of range measurements. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate that robust formation geometries improve the target robotâs confidence ellipse in the presence of positioning errors."
Learning Distributed End-to-End Hunting Locomotion for Multiple Quadruped Robots.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247461,"Quadruped robots have demonstrated remarkable versatility in various applications, from search and rescue to exploration.

Deep Equivariant Multi-Agent Control Barrier Functions.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246330,"With multi-agent systems increasingly deployed autonomously at scale in complex environments, ensuring safety of the data-driven policies is critical. Control Barrier Functions have emerged as an effective tool for enforcing safety constraints, yet existing learning-based methods often lack in scalability, generalization and sampling efficiency as they overlook inherent geometric structures of the system. To address this gap, we introduce symmetries-infused distributed CBFs, enforcing the satisfaction of intrinsic symmetries on learnable graph-based safety certificates. We theoretically motivate the need for equivariant parametrization of CBFs and policies, and propose a simple, yet efficient and adaptable methodology for constructing such equivariant group-modular networks via the compatible group actions. This approach encodes safety constraints in a distributed data-efficient manner, enabling zero-shot generalization to larger and denser swarms. Through extensive simulations on multi-robot navigation tasks, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of safety, scalability, and task success rates, highlighting the importance of embedding symmetries in safe distributed neural policies."
A Novel Large-Scale Collaborative Mapping Framework with Heterogeneous Point Clouds for Aerial-Ground Robots.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11245834,"Ground and aerial robots, with distinct sensing perspectives, acquire heterogeneous point clouds that exhibit limited overlap, presenting significant challenges for collaborative mapping. To address these challenges, this article proposes a robust LiDAR-based aerial-ground collaborative mapping framework for large-scale outdoor environments. Firstly, to perform reliable cross-source place recognition and detect loop closure between aerial-ground robots, a deep network that fuses multi-level birdâs-eye view (BEV) and geometric features is developed to ensure consistent feature extraction and emphasize overlaps between heterogeneous point clouds. Next, an overlap-aware registration method is proposed to align point clouds within a detected loop closure. This method can strategically perform point cloud sparsification based on overlap ratio estimation, and mitigate the adverse effects of interfering points in non-overlapping regions. Furthermore, a graph optimization is implemented to consider all loop closure constraints simultaneously and ensure global map consistency. Comparative experiments on public and self-collected datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. We open source code on GitHub<sup>1</sup> to benefit the community."

Traditional four-DOF (translation and scaling) trajectory planning struggles under such constraints. To overcome this, we propose an optimization-based framework that introduces rotational degrees of freedom, expanding the solution space to five dimensions. Using the MINCO transformation, we reformulate constrained formation adjustment into an unconstrained optimization problem via smooth mappings and penalty functions, enabling simultaneous obstacle avoidance and formation control. The GeoSafe algorithm further enhances safe passage by integrating iterative region expansion and semi-definite programming to maximize obstacle-free space.

Task-Aware Robotic Grasping by evaluating Quality Diversity Solutions through Foundation Models.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246636,"Task-aware robotic grasping is a challenging problem that requires the integration of semantic understanding and geometric reasoning. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Quality Diversity (QD) algorithms to enable zero-shot task-conditioned grasp synthesis. The framework segments objects into meaningful subparts and labels each subpart semantically, creating structured representations that can be used to prompt an LLM. By coupling semantic and geometric representations of an objectâs structure, the LLMâs knowledge about tasks and which parts to grasp can be applied in the physical world. The QD-generated grasp archive provides a diverse set of grasps, allowing us to select the most suitable grasp based on the task.

KGN-Pro: Keypoint-Based Grasp Prediction through Probabilistic 2D-3D Correspondence Learning.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246850,"High-level robotic manipulation tasks demand flexible 6-DoF grasp estimation to serve as a basic function. Previous approaches either directly generate grasps from point-cloud data, suffering from challenges with small objects and sensor noise, or infer 3D information from RGB images, which introduces expensive annotation requirements and discretization issues. Recent methods mitigate some challenges by retaining a 2D representation to estimate grasp keypoints and applying Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithms to compute 6-DoF poses. However, these methods are limited by their non-differentiable nature and reliance solely on 2D supervision, which hinders the full exploitation of rich 3D information. In this work, we present KGN-Pro, a novel grasping network that preserves the efficiency and fine-grained object grasping of previous KGNs while integrating direct 3D optimization through probabilistic PnP layers. KGN-Pro encodes paired RGB-D images to generate Keypoint Map, and further outputs a 2D confidence map to weight keypoint contributions during re-projection error minimization. By modeling the weighted sum of squared re-projection errors probabilistically, the network effectively transmits 3D supervision to its 2D keypoint predictions, enabling end-to-end learning.

Towards Extrinsic Dexterity Grasping in Unrestricted Environments.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246419,"Grasping large and flat objects (e.g., a book or a pan) is often regarded as an ungraspable task, which poses significant challenges due to the unreachable grasping poses. Prior research has exploited environmental interactions through Extrinsic Dexterity, utilizing external structures such as walls or table edges to facilitate object grasping. However, they are confined to task-specific policies while neglecting semantic perception and planning to identify optimal pre-grasp configurations. This limits their operational versatility, impeding effective adaptation to varied extrinsic dexterity constraints. In this work, we present ExDiff, a robot manipulation approach for extrinsic dexterity grasping in unrestricted environments. It utilizes Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to perceive the environmental state and generate instructions, followed by a Goal-Conditioned Action Diffusion (GCAD) model to predict the sequence of low-level actions. This diffusion model learns the low-level policy, conditioned on high-level instructions and cumulative rewards, which improves the generation of robot actions. Simulation experiments and real-world deployment results demonstrate that ExDiff effectively performs ungraspable tasks and generalizes to previously unseen target objects and scenes.

Previous studies primarily emphasized geometric analyses, neglecting dynamic factors, which limits their practical applicability. This study presents a multi-metric optimization framework to enhance the dynamic performance of humanoid robotic arms by optimizing the shoulderâs initial angle. We formulate a cost function that incorporates torque efficiency, energy consumption, and overload ratio, utilizing the differential evolution (DE) algorithm for optimization. Furthermore, to address the limitations of conventional geometric workspace analysis, we introduce the concept of effective workspace, integrating dynamic constraints to quantitatively evaluate the effects of optimized shoulder angles.

Traditionally, this process relies on human demonstrations captured through pose estimation or motion capture systems. In this paper, we explore a text-driven approach to obtain imitation motion data more flexibly and simply. To address the inherent discrepancies between the generated motion representations and the kinematic constraints of humanoid robots, we propose an angle signal network based on norm-position and rotation loss (NPR Loss). It generates joint angles, which serve as inputs to a reinforcement learning based whole-body motion control policy. The policy ensures tracking of the generated motions while maintaining the robotâs stability during execution.

Reprogramming for broader bodily interactions, such as gestures in various domains (e.g., construction), is nearly impossible unless expertise precedes. We introduce FABRIC, an end-to-end toolkit for fabricating and programming bodily language for unique human-robot interactions. The toolkit includes a fully 3D-printable robot, designed for consumer-grade FDM machinery, that learns from demonstration (LfD) to capture and translate usersâ bodily expressions through its upper torso (arms and hands) movements.

Parallel Transmission Aware Co-Design: Enhancing Manipulator Performance Through Actuation-Space Optimization.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246203,"In robotics, structural design and behavior optimization have long been considered separate processes, resulting in the development of systems with limited capabilities. Recently, co-design methods have gained popularity, where bi-level formulations are used to simultaneously optimize the robot design and behavior for specific tasks. However, most implementations assume a serial or tree-type model of the robot, overlooking the fact that many robot platforms incorporate parallel mechanisms. In this paper, we present a first co-design formulation that explicitly incorporates parallel coupling constraints into the dynamic model of the robot. In this framework, an outer optimization loop focuses on the design parameters, in our case the transmission ratios of a parallel belt-driven manipulator, which map the desired torques from the joint space to the actuation space. An inner loop performs trajectory optimization in the actuation space, thus exploiting the entire dynamic range of the manipulator. We compare the proposed method with a conventional co-design approach based on a simplified tree-type model. By taking advantage of the actuation space representation, our approach leads to a significant increase in dynamic payload capacity compared to the conventional co-design implementation."

Finding a good layout that minimizes the hardware budget while ensuring motion feasibility is a challenging combinatorial problem with nonconvex motion constraints. We propose a new optimization-based approach that models layout planning as a subgraph optimization problem subject to network flow constraints. Our core insight is to abstract away motion constraints from the layout optimization by precomputing a kinematic reachability graph and then extract the optimal layout on this ground graph. We validate the motion feasibility of our approach by proposing a simple task assignment and motion planning technique. We benchmark our algorithm on problems with various grid resolutions and number of outputs and show improvements in memory efficiency over a heuristic search algorithm.

This paper focuses on the localization of tomato trusses for autonomous harvesting by servoing a robot-mounted camera to different viewpoints. We build on previous work where the robot is provided with prior knowledge of the tomato plant. Specifically, the geometric relations between the trusses are modeled as ranges, which reflect uncertainty. Our main contribution is an approach that represents this uncertainty as polytope volumes. Polytopes enable scalable reasoning that facilitates likelihood estimation for viewpoint selection. Our method first constructs polytope hypotheses regarding the truss locations based on prior plant knowledge. It then refines the polytope shapes using Bayesian updates based on camera observations. Finally, the polytopes are used to select the next viewpoint that maximizes the chance of observing a new tomato truss. Experiments show that polytope-based viewpoint selection speeds up truss localization compared to earlier methods, advancing robotic harvesting."

IMMNN: Robust Wireless Electromagnetic-Inertial Fusion Tracking via Learning An Adaptive IMM.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247778,"Wireless Electromagnetic Tracking (WEMT) enables non-line-of-sight (NLoS) pose estimation in robotics but faces accuracy limitations from restricted operational range and environmental interference. This paper proposes a WEMT-inertial fusion system enhanced by a learning-based Interacting Multiple Model (IMMNN) to address these challenges. The framework integrates a multi-transmitter array with a WEMT-IMU fusion tracker, leveraging IMMNN to mitigate performance degradation caused by nonlinear spatial noise and motion uncertainty in dynamic, array-based environments. IMMNN employs a graph attention network to dynamically model spatial correlations among array units, adaptively optimizing state transition probabilities across motion models. A gated recurrent framework further enhances robustness by analyzing residual sequences to suppress transient noise and outliers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 30.4 mm over an expanded 1.9Ã1.9 m<sup>2</sup> operational area. The graph attention mechanism enables adaptive spatial noise suppression and ensures stable tracking under rapid motion and electromagnetic disturbances.

AKF-LIO: LiDAR-Inertial Odometry with Gaussian Map by Adaptive Kalman Filter.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246097,"Existing LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) systems typically use sensor-specific or environment-dependent measurement covariances during state estimation, leading to laborious parameter tuning and suboptimal performance in challenging conditions (e.g., sensor degeneracy and noisy observations). Therefore, we propose an Adaptive Kalman Filter (AKF) framework that dynamically estimates time-varying noise covariances of LiDAR and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements, enabling context-aware confidence weighting between sensors. During LiDAR degeneracy, the system prioritizes IMU data while suppressing contributions from unreliable inputs like moving objects or noisy point clouds. Furthermore, a compact Gaussian-based map representation is introduced to model environmental planarity and spatial noise. A correlated registration strategy ensures accurate plane normal estimation via pseudo-merge, even in unstructured environments like forests. Extensive experiments validate the robustness of the proposed system across diverse environments, including dynamic scenes and geometrically degraded scenarios. Our method achieves reliable localization results across all MARS-LVIG sequences and ranks 8th on the KITTI Odometry Benchmark. The code will be released at https://github.com/xpxie/AKF-LIO.git."
Opti-Acoustic Scene Reconstruction in Highly Turbid Underwater Environments.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247733,"Scene reconstruction is an essential capability for underwater robots navigating in close proximity to structures. Monocular vision-based reconstruction methods are unreliable in turbid waters and lack depth scale information. Sonars are robust to turbid water and non-uniform lighting conditions, however, they have low resolution and elevation ambiguity. This work proposes a real-time opti-acoustic scene reconstruction method that is specially optimized to work in turbid water. Our strategy avoids having to identify point features in visual data and instead identifies regions of interest in the data. We then match relevant regions in the image to corresponding sonar data. A reconstruction is obtained by leveraging range data from the sonar and elevation data from the camera image. Experimental comparisons against other vision-based and sonar-based approaches at varying turbidity levels, and field tests conducted in marina environments, validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We have made our code open-source to facilitate reproducibility and encourage community engagement."
BEV-LIO(LC): BEV Image Assisted LiDAR-Inertial Odometry with Loop Closure.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246238,"This work introduces BEV-LIO(LC), a novel LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) framework that combines Birdâs Eye View (BEV) image representations of LiDAR data with geometry-based point cloud registration and incorporates loop closure (LC) through BEV image features. By normalizing point density, we project LiDAR point clouds into BEV images, thereby enabling efficient feature extraction and matching. A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature extractor is employed to extract distinctive local and global descriptors from the BEV images. Local descriptors are used to match BEV images with FAST keypoints for reprojection error construction, while global descriptors facilitate loop closure detection. Reprojection error minimization is then integrated with point-to-plane registration within an iterated Extended Kalman Filter (iEKF). In the back-end, global descriptors are used to create a KD-tree-indexed keyframe database for accurate loop closure detection. When a loop closure is detected, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) computes a coarse transform from BEV image matching, which serves as the initial estimate for Iterative Closest Point (ICP). The refined transform is subsequently incorporated into a factor graph along with odometry factors, improving the global consistency of localization. Extensive experiments conducted in various scenarios with different LiDAR types demonstrate that BEVLIO(LC) outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving competitive localization accuracy.

Despite the variety of existing soft gripper designs, their structures lack sufficient flexibility for effectively grasping slender objects or operating in narrow spaces. To address these challenges, we propose a soft gripper with single-finger grasping capabilities, inspired by the structure of crab claws. The structural design and the fabrication method of the gripper are introduced, and the analytical bending model is derived. Experiments are conducted under typical operating conditions to validate the model, and the results indicate that the measured data are in good accordance with the predicted responses. Furthermore, a series of grasping experiments are carried out to test the single-finger grasping capabilities of the proposed soft gripper. The results indicate that the proposed soft gripper can efficiently and stably grasp slender or irregular objects with a single finger. In particular, it demonstrates suitability for operations in narrow spaces and shows potential for handling complex tasks. This innovative design effectively reduces the complexity of the system, while exhibiting promising capabilities in grasping slender or irregular objects and operating within restricted spaces."
Design and Development of a Propulsion Induced Rolling Spherical Tensegrity Robot.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246432,"Spherical tensegrity structure has good dynamic stability, support strength and flexibility, and is widely used in the field of mobile robot research. Most of the tensegrity spherical robots deform themselves to make gravity work to realize the motion, but the deformation of both rods and ropes affects the robot's motion efficiency and motion instability. In this paper, a new type of tensegrity spherical robot is proposed, which is powered by six fixed ducted thrusters, and the thrust is provided to induce the robot to roll when in different attitudes. This paper firstly introduces the structural design and principle of the robot. Secondly analyzes the magnitude of the propulsive force required for the robot's motion and establishes a kinematic model. Finally, the robot prototype model was built and the robot motion experiments were conducted in simulation and the real environment respectively. The experimental results show that the robot has a simple structure but high motion efficiency, and has a strong ability to adapt to the environment."
Towards Deformation Modeling and Simulation of a Soft and Inflatable Endoscopic Vision-Based Tactile Sensing Balloon for Cancer Diagnosis.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246502,"In this study, we introduce a simulation-based modeling framework for the optimal design of our recently developed inflatable endoscopic vision-based tactile sensing balloon (E-VTSB). Of note, E-VTSB is designed for providing a safe and high-resolution textural mapping and morphology characterization of colorectal cancer (CRC) polyps to enhance the early diagnosis of cancerous polyps. Leveraging the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA) software and by performing complementary experimental validation, we thoroughly analyzed and investigated the impact of the elastic modulus of the material constitution of E-VTSB on its deformation behavior under different applied pressures. Our findings revealed a close correlation between the simulated outcomes and experimental data performed on two different E-VTSBs. In particular, with the maximum absolute deformation error of <12%, our results clearly validated the proposed frameworkâs accuracy in predicting the E-VTSBâs deformation trend and its potential use for optimizing the design parameters."
Hybrid Control Approach for Walking-Assembly Integrated Space Robots in On-Orbit Assembly*.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246896,"As space exploration advances, the demand for assembling large-scale structures in orbit, such as telescopes and space stations, continues to grow due to transportation size constraints. Robotic systems play a critical role in these tasks, requiring precise control and efficient energy management in the challenging conditions of space. This paper proposes a hybrid control strategy that combines Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the performance of a 7-degree-of-freedom walking-assembly integrated space robot. MPC optimizes control inputs by predicting the robot's response over a defined horizon while handling constraints in real time, and RL dynamically tunes MPC parameters to adapt the control system to task-specific priorities. The proposed controller operates in two distinct modes: energy-efficient mode and accuracy-focused mode, balancing energy consumption and task precision. Simulation results validate the approach, demonstrating significant energy savings while maintaining high accuracy during space assembly tasks."
VLM-Empowered Multi-Mode System for Efficient and Safe Planetary Navigation.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247594,"The increasingly complex and diverse planetary exploration environment requires more adaptable and flexible rover navigation strategy. In this study, we propose a VLM-empowered multi-mode system to achieve efficient while safe autonomous navigation for planetary rovers. Vision-Language Model (VLM) is used to parse scene information by image inputs to achieve a human-level understanding of terrain complexity. Based on the complexity classification, the system switches to the most suitable navigation mode, composing of perception, mapping and planning modules designed for different terrain types, to traverse the terrain ahead before reaching the next waypoint.

MPC-based Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Space Robotic Control with Fuel Sloshing Mitigation.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247300,"This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for autonomous satellite docking with a partially filled fuel tank. Traditional docking control faces challenges due to fuel sloshing in microgravity, which induces unpredictable forces affecting stability. To address this, we integrate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPCâs predictive capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with fuel sloshing dynamics.

VDTF-ACT: ACT-based Multimodal Space Fine Manipulation Method with Visual Depth Tactile Fusion.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246342,"Autonomous fine manipulation in space for orbital assembly continues to present a critical challenge in the field of aerospace engineering. Under low-gravity conditions, during satellite manipulator operations on free-floating objects, the absence of significant gravitational forces and friction constraints leads to unpredictable relative motions between the manipulatorâs end-effectors and objects, degrading the manipulation performance. This study proposes a fine manipulation method for satellite robots with floating platforms, grounded in multimodal perception and an enhanced Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT) architecture that enables multimodal state interaction. By integrating visual, tactile, and depth sensory data, the satellite robotâs space fine manipulation capabilities are substantially improved.

AVIP: Acoustic-Visual-Inertial-Pressure Fusion-based Underwater Localization System with Multi-Centric Calibration.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246675,"Underwater localization is a crucial capability for ensuring robust and accurate vehicle navigation. Although various well-developed localization systems exist, their primary focus is on ground and aerial applications.

This paper presents AVIP, a localization method that fuses Acoustic, Visual, Inertial, and Pressure modalities for underwater applications. To integrate the information from all modalities during initialization, visual and inertial modalities are alternately assigned as centric sensors to pairwise predict and update estimations of other modalities. The multi-centric calibration problem is addressed through factor graph optimization, which is fully integrated into the graph-based AVIP system as the calibration factor.

Decentralized Declustering of Multiple Underactuated Autonomous Surface Vehicles: Managing Robot Swarms in the Field.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246947,"The task of deploying a large number of autonomous vehicles is challenging, risky and often overlooked in the literature. These vehicles are typically deployed from a single location, and their underactuated nature, close proximity, and susceptibility to external disturbances make it difficult to achieve a mission-ready configuration without collisions. In this paper, we address the problem of transitioning a set of underactuated Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) from arbitrary and inconvenient initial conditions, to a deconflicted set of deployed vehicles. We propose a decentralized and scalable method that assigns the vehicles to their target positions, generates optimal paths given minimum turning radii and assures collision avoidance between the vehicles. Performance is verified through simulation and extensive field trials. Results demonstrate that our approach improves the time to decluster with 58% compared to the current manual method. By improving efficiency and robustness while eliminating human involvement, this work streamlines ASV fleet deployments, enabling more effective multi-agent field operations."
MCE-based Direct FTC Method for Dynamic Positioning of Underwater Vehicles with Thruster Redundancy.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246250,"This paper presents an active, model-based FTC (fault tolerant control) method for the dynamic positioning of underwater vehicles with thruster redundancy. Unlike conventional appraoches that rely heavily on state and parameter estimation, the proposed scheme directly utilizes the vehicleâs motion control error (MCE) to construct a residual for detecting thruster faults and failures during the steady state operation of the control system. One of the primary challenges in thruster fault identification is the unavailability of the actual control input under fault conditions. However, by conducting a detailed and rigorous analysis of the MCE variation trends associated with thruster faults, valuable information about this unknown control input can be extracted. This insight forms the foundation of the proposed FTC strategy. As for control reconfiguration, itâs straightforward since the thrust losses can be directly estimated through the fault identification process. Numerical studies with the real world vehicle model are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Distributed Cooperative Target Tracking and Active Sensing of Dual-AUV Based on Flank Array Sonar Detection.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11245881,"When tracking underwater target, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) need to estimate the target state based on the information detected by sensors and plan their own tracking paths accordingly to achieve active sensing of the target. When the sensor equipped on the AUV is a flank array sonar, the problem becomes significantly more complex due to the limited field of view (FOV) of the sonar and the fact that bearing-only information is available for observation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a distributed solution for cooperative tracking and active sensing using dual-AUV systems equipped with flank array sonar for detection. Based on the analysis of underwater acoustic communication modes in dual-AUV systems, this study decomposes the problem into two aspects: cooperative estimation and planning control for active sensing. Corresponding algorithms are proposed and their effectiveness is verified."
A Sim-to-Real Transfer Framework for Enhancing Marine Vehicle Performance in Ocean Environments.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246159,"Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained attention for complex decision-making in uncertain environments. However, high costs and risks of real-world experimentation limit its direct application to marine vehicles. This motivates the use of simulation-based training and sim-to-real transfer techniques. Despite growing interest, a systematic understanding of how to design effective transfer strategies for marine contexts remains lacking. This paper presents a sim-to-real transfer framework tailored for marine vehicles, integrating high-fidelity, data-driven dynamics modeling with multi-factor domain randomization to address marine environmental uncertainties. Maneuvering data is utilized to extract nonlinear hydrodynamic characteristics of marine vehicles to enhance model realism. Additionally, domain randomization is explored across multiple environmental factors, including wind, wave, and current. To evaluate transferability, we construct a sim-to-sim platform with a pseudo-real environment that emulates the reality gap and adopt a path-following task using Soft Actor-Critic. We comprehensively assess the impacts of model fidelity and environmental randomization strategies on sim-to-real transfer performance. Results indicate that model accuracy positively impacts transfer performance, while aggressive domain randomization may reduce adaptability in calm conditions. Finally, a data-driven modeling and multi-factor randomization recipe is proposed for RL policy transfer in marine applications."
Design and Dynamic Modeling Analysis of Undulatory Propulsion Underwater Robot with Rotational Passive Degrees of Freedom in Fin Rays.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247062,"Current research on undulatory propulsion robots has predominantly centered on hydrodynamic performance simulations. However, challenges such as limited mobility and difficulties in parameter identification during underwater bio-mimetic motion remain unresolved. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel undulating fin robot featuring passive rotational joints, aiming to enhance motion capabilities and facilitate more accurate modeling. These joints enhance both the agility and stability of the robot's movements. Initially, the research develops models for the undulatory motion of the undulating fin and the rotational passive degrees of freedom in the fin rays. Based on fluid drag theory, a hydrodynamic model for undulating fin propulsion is constructed to analyze the thrust, lateral force, and lift generated at varying frequencies. Furthermore, a comprehensive dynamics model for the underwater motion of the biomimetic undulating fin robot is developed. Numerical simulations of the robot's non-steady-state motion are conducted to identify the hydrodynamic parameters of the model, thereby enabling the solution of the dynamic model. The experimental results demonstrate that the robot achieves an underwater straight-line motion speed exceeding 0.5m/s, a turning speed of approximately 45Â°/s, and an inclined upward motion speed of 0.21 m/s. This study provides a novel approach for the design of underwater undulating fin robots and the resolution of kinematic models for underwater robots. It is hoped that this research can contribute to the further development of undulatory propulsion robot technology."
Coordinated Energy-Trajectory Economic Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Surface Vehicles under Disturbances.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247496,"The paper proposes a novel Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) scheme for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) to simultaneously address path following accuracy and energy constraints under environmental disturbances. By formulating lateral deviations as energy-equivalent penalties in the cost function, our method enables explicit trade-offs between tracking precision and energy consumption. Furthermore, a motion-dependent decomposition technique is proposed to estimate terminal energy costs based on vehicle dynamics. Compared with the existing EMPC method, simulations with real-world ocean disturbance data demonstrate the controllerâs energy consumption with a 0.06% energy increase while reducing cross-track errors by up to 18.61%. Field experiments conducted on an ASV equipped with an Intel N100 CPU in natural lake environments validate practical feasibility, achieving 0.22 m average cross-track error at nearly 1 m/s and 10 Hz control frequency. The proposed scheme provides a computationally tractable solution for ASVs operating under resource constraints."
L2Calib: SE (3)-Manifold Reinforcement Learning for Robust Extrinsic Calibration with Degenerate Motion Resilience.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246454,"Extrinsic calibration is essential for multi-sensor fusion, existing methods rely on structured targets or fully-excited data, limiting real-world applicability. Online calibration further suffers from weak excitation, leading to unreliable estimates. To address these limitations, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based extrinsic calibration framework that formulates extrinsic calibration as a decisionmaking problem, directly optimizes SE(3) extrinsics to enhance odometry accuracy. Our approach leverages a probabilistic Bingham distribution to model 3D rotations, ensuring stable optimization while inherently retaining quaternion symmetry. A trajectory alignment reward mechanism enables robust calibration without structured targets by quantitatively evaluating estimated tightly-coupled trajectory against a reference trajectory. Additionally, an automated data selection module filters uninformative samples, significantly improving efficiency and scalability for large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on UAVs, UGVs, and handheld platforms demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional optimization-based approaches, achieving high-precision calibration even under weak excitation conditions. Our framework simplifies deployment on diverse robotic platforms by eliminating the need for high-quality initial extrinsics and enabling calibration from routine operating data.

Hyla-SLAM: Toward Maximally Scalable 3D LiDAR-Based SLAM Using Dynamic Memory Management and Behavior Trees.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11247133,"Solving the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem is essential for most mobile robotics applications that do not have an a priori environment representation. The SLAM problem is well-studied, with previous works demonstrating impressive results with a variety of robots, sensors, and environments. However, despite the widespread need for SLAM solutions across a broad spectrum of robotics disciplines and applications, it remains challenging to quickly and easily scale existing solutions to new robots, environments, and tasks. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing Hyla-SLAM, a framework for 3D LiDAR-based SLAM that uses dynamic memory management to efficiently create and manage maps of environments of arbitrary size and density. Hyla-SLAM also scales to diverse systems and applications by using behavior trees to maximize runtime flexibility and extensibility. We demonstrate the scalability of Hyla-SLAM in experiments using datasets collected in North America, Europe, and Asia to generate a single, unified global-scale map thousands of kilometers across that can be efficiently accessed and expanded. We also show experiments using the behavior tree interface to make robot- or task-informed modifications that enable deployment on heterogeneous robots with varying system constraints. These results demonstrate the frameworkâs ability to efficiently create and manage huge maps while generalizing to a wide range of systems and applications with minimal reconfiguration.

LiDAR-Inertial Odometry in Dynamic Driving Scenarios using Label Consistency Detection.,https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS60139.2025.11246976,"In this paper, a LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) method that eliminates the influence of moving objects in dynamic driving scenarios is proposed. This method constructs binarized labels for 3D points of current sweep, and utilizes the label difference between each point and its surrounding points in global map to identify moving objects. The surrounding points in global map are localized by voxel-location-based nearest neighbor search, without involving any massive computations. In addition, the proposed method is embeded into a LIO system (i.e., Dynamic-LIO), and achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets with extremlely low computational overhead (i.e., 1~9ms/sweep).
